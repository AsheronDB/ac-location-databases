      "description": "drudges and outcasts. crowd in the basement not sure whats there. <I>\t-- Guy Noir 1/4/00 </I><br>This is the screwyest Dungeon I think I have seen to date...  The entrance portal is guarded on the south and the west by Banderling Scouts and Young Banderlings as well as Green Phyntos Wasps, Outcast Monouga, Mite Snippets, and a few Shreth...  Inside, there are essentially 3 levels... the level you enter into has two or three Drudge Skulkers (lvl 2), one Drudge Slinker (lvl 4), and one Outcast Monouga...  This entry level also has a stamina fountain in the middle of it, but there are no chests and loot is minimal...  On the lower level (that is, down the ramp from the entry level), there are three Outcasts all gathered in one chamber, and a looped hallway that goes from one end of the chamber, behind the chamber, and to the other end of the chamber... in the hall are two Gnawer Shreths...  On this level of the dungeon there are also no chests, though I don't know about loot because I ran in, looked around, and left without killing anything...  On the upper level (that is, up the ramp from the entry level) there is a long hall with several side chambers (six I think)... all but one or two of those chambers have enemy creatures in them, and those creatures are usually in groups of 2-4 creatures...  There are mostly Drudge Sneakers (lvl 4 I think), but one of the chambers has two Outcasts and a chest...  only About half of these chambers have doors, so expect to get swarmed a bit...  The chest that I mentioned has low level cloths, and a little food...  At the end of the hall on this level, there is a locked gate (I have not yet found a key), and behind it there is a very small cavity with a single Drudge Sneaker and a chest... since I haven't found a key and I don't have a very good Lock Picking skill (only level 35), and since I haven't been able to kill everything on the level, I haven't been able to get into the chest or even through the door... in fact, I died three times trying before I gave up and decided I need to wait and go in with a group...  I recomend never going into this dungeon before level three, and only with at least one other person, unless you plan to stay on the bottom two levels...  When I have more info about the chest on the upper level, I will add it. <I>\t-- ANM 3/28/2001 </I><br>OK, I finally was able to open the locked gate on the top level (I used lockpick with a \"\"Reliable Lockpick\"\") and got into the chest (on the second attempt... after the first time, I died right before I got into the chest)...  This dungeon is not worth the trouble...  The chest contained all of 9 pyreals...  All this dungeon is worth is exp, and even that can be better recieved in other places...  Don't bother with this dungeon... ever. <I>\t-- ANM 3/28/2001 </I>"

Sorry I didn't need to wait several hours for the armor. <I>\t-- ~Confucious 2/4/00 </I><br>The Green Mire Cuirass is a set of Green Yori armor that is great for characters of any class for use until well into their 20?s if they wish. It covers upper, and lower body. It is located in the Green Mire Grave not far from Shoushi. This is an adventure for characters of at least level 12 in a group, or level 18+ solo. From Shoushi head to the Lifestone at 25.7 S 74.8 E. There is also a house here that is safe to rest in, if you have been injured by the area?s nasties. From here head to the dungeon location at 27.8 S 71.7 E about a 3 minute real time run. The portal is surrounded by several pillars of stone. Inside you will find your self in a large room with 4 exits, and 4 surface portals. Through 1 exit you can get to the Green Mire Yari (see that quest) from another you can get to the Green Mire Cuirass. ****** WARNING****** The next section contains SPOILERS do not read this if you want to discover the dungeon on your own. Ok, you have been warned. For the Cuirass head to the West exit. Stick to the wall on your left until you come to an opening to your right with stairs down. The 2nd opening I think. Go down. When you get to the 4-way intersection go left to the end of the hall. There will be a door here to be picked. Not too hard. As you descend the stairs you will encounter several different Mosswarts. Barkers, Feeders, and Mudlurks. At the bottom the hall will turn left. There is a large room here. At the far end is a chest, with some minor magical traps on it. This is where the Cuirass pops. The chest is pickable, but for those of you, who can not pick, the Mosswart Chief drops the key to the chest. In either corner of the room pops Mosswart Shamans. They can cast some nasty spells, and for the lower level adventurer this can be deadly. Also, there is a stone arch. This is where a Ghost Wisp pops. The cycle is about 30 min. All monster, except the Wisp will pop 2X before the next chest pop. When you see the Wisp pop, that is the sign that the Cuirass has popped. Vylarn Monarch of the Elite Brotherhood Harvestgain. <I>\t-- Vylarn 5/10/2000 </I><br>The place is soooooooo crowded.  Forget the Curias, just pick up all the loot everyone else isn't intersted in.  I make from 15-30k a run. <I>\t-- Bleys Icefalcon 5/23/2000 </I><br>when u get to the intersection it is right not left <I>\t-- lighting strike 9/23/2000 </I><br>The correct directions for the Green Mire Cuirass: From the entrance, head west.  Take first left. Take first right. at the crossroads take a right, not a left.  Follow to a locked door and pick it. Follow beyond the dorr to the room with the chest. <I>\t-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 </I><br>Key for the West wing door is located in the north wing on a barker moswart. <I>\t-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 </I><br>I have also found a red key that says it goes to 'a prison door in the Green Mire Grave'. <I>\t-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 </I><br>If you dont have lock pick here is what you do.  From the entrance, head North into the dead end section, kill the barker mosswart, grab his key.  Go back to entrance area, head East until you reach an area with a locked door going upstairs.  Use the key you just got off the barker and head on in.  This area leads further upstairs until you reach the grave area, which is the highest point of the dungeon.  You can get the prison cell key off the low level mosswart (its redish).  Return to the entrance area then head South.  The southern area is small, 2 low lev mosswarts and a few drudges.  In the drudge area, you get the prison cell chest key off the big drudge.  After heading back to the entrance, head West. Take a left on the first fork in the hall, then make an immediate right heading downwards. At the 4 way crossroad, make left, kill the 2 mosswarts and use the red key to open up the prison cell.  Use the key you got off the drudge to open the chest.  Inside the chest is a key that opens the BIG door that leads downstairs and all of its medium level baddies.  Once downstairs, you must kill the Chief mosswart in order to get the key that opens the chest which gives you the Green Mire armor. To open the chest in the upstairs section (East from entrance) you need to kill a mosswart in the West/Upstairs section.  Cant miss him, he has a barker and shamen to keep him company. NOTE: This place can often be camped by high level monarchs obtaining easy armor for their vassels.  <I>\t-- prok 1/3/2001 </I><br>NOTE:This dungeon is allmost allways camped by everyone all of the time.Expect to wait for many hours for the armor during peak hours.and you can forget about getting the yari.if you come at midnight there might not be anyone around but you better be able to solo everything from the weakest mosswarts all the way up to the mosswart cheif and the wisp that guards the chest with the armor.unless your level 20 or 30+ then your screwed no matter what. <I>\t-- Sega Slayer 3/24/2001 </I><br>heh...now everyhting I said in my last post is innaccurate.

But are heavily gaurded byt 7 level 103 Magma golems. Campers are here mainly to level as each magma golem will give 9000 exp. In this cave are Magma's, iron, obsidian, granite & copper golems 2 knath's also. lol the entered by slot wont fit my whole name so  Im putting it herre :) Habib the terrible <I> 11/30/99 </I><br>Great place for life mages to lvl.  If possible, come here at lvl 15 (the lvl limit).  There are so many cheap spots among the granites, and once you can take them out easily, the magmas wait below.  In the entrance room, 3 granites spawn across from you, to left and right will be 2 portals.  Get up next to the wall between the portal and the granites, a bit closer to the portal, and use life magic to kill all granies without them being able to get to you.  Go down into a room with a chandelier.  Take the center hallway from there.  There you see a little V shape split.  Lure guys here, run on opp side of V from them, and more easy XP.  Also, granites cant run underneath the chandelier if you lure them up there.  Copper golems can however.  Next take a right.  There will be 1 granite right there, lure him out, and kill him.  Now you can go in, turn left, and get next to the wall.  From there you can hit the granite who, if done right, is stuck against the corner.  He can still get you with magic though.  The other you can lure behind a big rock thats aroudn the corner.  If you would have taken a left up higher, you end up going towards the magmas, and after you kill the first4 granies, there is another wall u can use to hide behind. For magmas, when you jump down, run forward a small bit, and turn right towards a portal.  Go into the corner near the magma there, easy harming and draining. Go back out to main hallway and go as you were going.  A bit ahead, near a lot of magmas, there is a ramp to your right, sit on the ramp for more easy XP. <I>\t-- Flamelord 1/5/00 </I><br>Life magic sucks :-] <I>\t-- Nightwolf 2/1/00 </I><br>I agree withthe Above statement. Hopefully a said by the designers, Magma's will start learning the spells cast on them  <I>\t-- Keric Horde 3/2/2000 </I><br>How in the hell do you get inside the rim of the crater by running? I've been to the dungeon via portal before.(player summoned) <I>\t-- Juliet Dominici 3/9/2000 </I><br>Come here if you wish to obtain an Atlan weapon.  There are a total of 8 chances per spawn, if you manage to kill the 4 coppers, 3 irons, and the obsidian and leave nothing behind for anybody else.  The mote spawn here ranges from poor to excellent.  Don't bother with granites if you only want motes, but sometimes they just get.  Nice place to power level and work on a quest at the same time. <I>\t-- Xcalibur 3/27/2000 </I><br>Cool place for Mages who like to power-level by draining.  Virtually solely populated by the said Life Mages with only the occasional warrior or archer to be seen.  Creatures have been described above but the danger wasn't really emphasised :)  The very bottom is huge and spawns lots of Magmas.  Good fun draining them if that's what you like, but at the same time you're slowly taking damage from the heat down there.  And in response to a previous poster, the magmas now know their life spells :)  - they now drain you :).  Also home to Flares (lvl 12?), Flammas (lvl 43?) and Infernos (lvl 121).  Flares and Flammas are no problem to 25+ Mages, the Infernos are a different matter :).  Crap loot except for the occasional black rock from the magmas, black stone from the obsidian above or the even more occasional spawning mote from everything bar the Granites. A previous poster mentioned dropping down to the Magmas at level 15; well unless you've got someone with you who can dump a yield on them (at least IV) I wouldn't bother... my life is 240 and I still get resist, resist, resist :) If you want to practice on the Fire Elementals (Flare/Flamma/Inferno) before you go down then look no further than the Crater Lake :), just get ready to run from the Inferno, he hurts. <I>\t-- Laz al-Farah 4/27/2000 </I><br>Sturdy iron key opens chest at bottom <I>\t-- Shoto Fle-Alch 5/7/2000 </I><br>You can access the crater via a passage on the rim on its southwest side.  The passage is guarded by one (or two) groups of a Flamma and two Flares and is visibly marked by tall columns on both the entrance and exit sides.  Trying to jump in elsewhere can get you killed (even with 170 health..). <I>\t-- Tell of William 7/6/2000 </I><br>They changed the bottom of this place in the July 2000 patch.  No uber chests down there now; the chests remain open, they don't even need picking.  The spawn of Magmas in the very bottom has been reduced considerably.  Where this was once an open area with a large lava pit in it, it is now populated with lots of small hut type structures which could be forges.  Next to one of the forges is a set of Pyreal Forge Bellows.  These are no drop, but I have no idea as to their use. <I>\t-- Laz al-Farah 7/13/2000 </I><br>I don't know if this is just pure luck or what but I went here before June patch 2001 and got 1 SIK for about every 100 magma golems I killed. But now I get one for every 10-20. :) Now I can get some level 6 scrolls, thanks turbine.

Watch out when hitting the drudges in town, the high level drudges protect the lower level drudges. Dont be suprised when you get swarmed by 10 banderlings and 4 drudge lurkers at once. The portal is in a house guarded by 4 banderling guards. You need a special key to open the door unless you can pick a 600 diff door.  <I> -- Homer the Wise 7/3/2001 </i><br>Now you can find everything from Banderling Guards to Banderling Enforcers here.  There are now every remotly high lv monster here. I have seen everything form Linch Lords, Shad Lts, Greviers (sp),Monouga, Giga Luggies, Tusker Slaves, Dire Matties...

The barrons key can be found on an undead(cant remember which type miner?)in the cell area its the cell door at end of hall. Which actualy isnt realy a cell its another hallway that curves to the left leading to more cells. He also drops the sratched key which is used in Life Giver Quest.

Inside the chest is the BANDIT SHIELD (AL 60, Flame Protection Other II). The chest has a resistance of 500. I never no clue if there is a key for it, or where it might be located.

So if you are like me and like checking out unknown areas in armor that is not a problem to lose (coming back with your good stuff once you know you can handle it), here is the place to get basic Yoroi stuff. Its also not a problem to get to...run NW from Shoushi on the road that passes the GMG. Not hard at all. <I>\t-- Zimbalt 5/18/2000 </i><br>  I liked Sawato, The swamp can be a pain but there is a life stone with a Mage to thee North as well as a Mosswart Tower that holds mudlurks, barkers, and a shaman.  If you head North through the swamp and into the mountains you can find another lifestone. In the mountains there is a mosswart Chief and many other good monsters. <I>\t-- MojoRisen 5/26/2000 </i><br>My opinion of Sawato has improved since my previous entry.  Lifestones are now close by both east and northwest, the mage shop has low prices, there is a trophy smith and a wing collector, I can use blunt arrowheads, and its close to the Sho Roadside exit point. <I>\t-- Doc Feelgood 6/10/2000 </i><br>If you want blunt arrowheads (and you do.), this is the place to get them. <I>\t-- Keef the Thief 12/8/2000 </i><br>If youre looking for plants with which to dye your armor red, the swamps to the west are a great place to find them. <I>\t-- Sixfingers 12/10/2000 </i><br>The mage here now sells plat, pyreal, and gold scarabs. <I>\t-- Xarion of MT 3/5/2001 </i><br>Casino nearby, It should be a boom town soon.

In June patch the surrounding area is hosting some Auroch Fire cattle. <I>\t-- Doc Feelgood 6/15/2000 </I><br>Two level 20-ish Archers made a pilgrimage to the town.  We killed many undead and zombies and liches, but there were too many.  We were not able to loot the dead undead.  You will take bolts from every direction, you will be attacked by armoredillos and shreths and mites when you attempt to heal yourself in the trees.  The tent will not hide you.  We were forced to flee after we ran out of arrows.  We never did get close to clearing hte place.  If you come, come loaded, and ready for an epic battle.  This place is far out of the way.  You can spend an afternoon in non-stop combat, just you and the monsters.  We attempted to take the buildings, and engaged in some fabulous building to building street fighting.  But ultimately we were repulsed.  WARNING, the trip home may be even more dangerous than the town itself, especially if you blow your supply of arrows.   <I>\t-- Jann 9/29/2000 </I>"

      "description": "Just North of Holtburg. Got some skeletons and a lich down on the lower levels... <I>\t-- Garf 11/19/99 </I><br>   Exit near enterance. Early parts filled with little Drudge Skulkers galore. In the early rooms, fighting one will usually bring a lot of them if someone hasn't taken care of them. Takes a bit of exploring to find Sneakers or higher drudges and a bit more running to get to the area with Undead and such (there's a sign with a portal in the room before you enter the area with undead.) SoLL key here, look for it in one of the lower, smaller, white skinned creatures. <I>\t-- Garfield3d 11/25/99 </I><br>To go in the lower level you must absolutely have a lockpick...  Beware for undead...  If you stay in the higher level there is only Drudges... It's good to gain xp for low level players...  <I>\t-- Galadriel 12/22/99 </I><br>Worn Small Key <I>\t-- Wormtongue 2/23/2000 </I><br>This dungeon is now level 1 - 10. <I>\t-- WuJen 2/27/2000 </I><br>Lich near bottom, spawns in room with locked coffin that has some pretty nice magic jewelry for a lvl1-10 dungeon.  Taking out the lich at  < lvl10 requires a lot of teamwork and strategy and is very fun. <I>\t-- Machina 3/5/2000 </I><br>How does one enter the lower level without a lockpick? (Or anyone else who has one.) Is there a key somewhere? <I>\t-- Tim 6/13/2000 </I><br>To get through locked doors, have a friend with lockpick skill or create a new character with the skill and log that char behind the locked doors (there are many doors though). The 3rd level is great for level 4+ chars; tons of undead. Great for leveling and getting good loot for the dungeon's level restriction. Don't piss the lich off (on level 4). <I>\t-- Lifestoner 10/8/2000 </I><br>Dont even waste your time looking in the UNlocked sarcophagous-there is nothing there... If you beat the lich and end up in a room full of light, hug the walls, dont get in the middle of the room or you will meet an electrifing fate of a one who was scorched by a lightning trap... The sarcophagous in that room contain good jewelery as does the loot from the Lich-but watch out he is easilly boodered and not easily distacted from killing a character that \"\"pissed him off\"\" P.S. How come there are people of level 15< there? I thought the dungeon was restricted to 1-10 lvl... <I>\t-- Witold 3/2/2001 </I><br>There is no way to get to the bottom section without lockpick.  The SoLL key spawns on one of the white rats in th lower section.  There are level 15's here occasionally camping the undead, which can be fought and killed through the door.  If you leveled while in the dungeon, it does not kick you out. <I>\t-- War Mongress 3/4/2001 </I><br>Drudge Slaves, Spikey Armoredillos, Swamp Rats, Sandy Armoredillo, Limestone Golem, Jade Gromines. Lower lockpicked levels unchanged. No level restrictions. SoLL key on the level 11 Swamp Rat. <I> -- Charles t Great 7/20/2003 </I>Other than one SoLL Key, this dungeon also has 2 Spikey and one Sandy Armoredillo on a 5 minute spawn. A place to hunt hides if you are desperate. <I>-- Taarna Blood SC 9/13/2004</I>"

Ice walls and ice roof looks very cool.  Worth a trip just to look. <I> -- Shogo Akai</i><br>its part of the frost quest, at the very bottom is a room with 2 iron golems guarding a book. you can only open the door with the key you get from the madman at the gates of Bandit prison <I>\t-- El Shrimpo 12/28/99 </i><br>Shrimpo was right, the place is really cool looking. Me (17th lvl War) and my Monarch (21st lvl Archer) checked it out. 1st off, for you platemail wearing guys like me, the Ice Gromies blast a nasty breath of zub-zero cold. I took like 14-20 points per blast and a 38 pt critical. Be prepared, not like me standing with an Ice Tachi in hand. Big 0 damage. Down past about 6 of thease and a handful of Rats you come to a deadend room with a large opening in the middle. Lokk down, there is a bridge that you can safely jump too, but be ready for another Ice gromie. One way will go to a deadend with am Ice Golem. Not too tough, less deadly than the Gromies I thought. The other way lead around to another deadend, but with a room to jump down into. 1 or 2 Ice Golems here. There is a deadend hall one way, a set of stairs up the other and a door out. Up the stairs will take you to another bridge and you will see the Lich that was been casting all the spells on you while you were down below. Across the bridge is a locked door. This must be the one you need to have the key from, and there were 2 Iron Golems in there, 42nd level. (shiver) We didnt have the key so we went back down to the other door. Open this and there is a T intersection. If you are around our level, and you go right, you will go right to the lifestone, dont pass go, dont collect 200 pyerels. 42 lvl Iron Golem. Hit me with a spell for 55 pts dmg, and smashed my monarch for over 100, for an instant death. But, if you just haul ass to the left, you will see the exit portal. Good luck,   - Vylarn of Harvestgain <I>\t-- Vylarn 1/10/00 </i><br>I did this level as a level 25 war/life/item mage - no real problems.  Just take it slow. At the end, you will be under a rope/wood bridge.  At the top, a Lich was powerless while I drained him.  He didnt spawn for > 10 minutes.  I went to where he stood, in front of the door, and drained the 2 iron golems.  Used the key to go inside and get my loot.  No real problem here.  Cave looked really cool.  Just watch out for ice golems and ivory gromnies. <I>\t-- Vincent Price 3/31/2000 </i><br>If you cant Drain or Harm your enemies try this out. When you get to the end of the dungeon, where the 2 irons guard the book, run up to the door after kiling the lich, then slide over to the left of it, 99% of the time one of the irons will come to the door while the other gets stuck on the wall, now you can chop his grimy arse to bits while he throws spell after spell into the dorr (not one came thru after more than 10 kills (for test purposes). Then if u have the key, go on in and take down the other at your leisure. One more thing, the Ivory Groms spit fire NOT ice, and there is one bridge that you shouldnt dilly on as it has a CHILL AIR patch on it and will give you the sniffles. <I>\t-- Usagi Rai 5/6/2000 </i>Stop #16 in the Undead Mechanic quest added in the October 2003 patch. Yes, you still need to make the specialized carrot soup to give to the guy at the Bandit castle. <I>-- Geomancer 11/16/2003</i>Cave was upgraded with wasteland rats and ebon gromnies. Fast respawn rate in upper level. See ACMaps for dungeon details. Good experience for the midlevel player who can take on the rats and gromnies with minimal damage. No level restriction, cannot summon, but can recall.<br><br>Salvage quality runs from 3 - 7 on average. Can make decent money from looting bodies. Made +100k per visit. Playing Lv56 tank axer on WE, made Lv57 in about 3 hours of play time.<br><br>Lifestone tie at Bandit Castle. Short run from there.

Dont count on fighting individual Tuskers<br> expect at least 3 or 4 to attack you at once, usually more.  One way tie to portal<br> you can only tie from outside so that you appear inside, and if someones dragged a score of Tuskers to the entrance and youre not buffed, then be ready for the LS :).  Ive never managed to hit the very bottom, but have made it to the third level down before our party of six was reduced to two through deaths or playing the chicken :)  Encountered Slaves on first level with the odd Guard, all Guards on levels below plus a Virindi (sp?) Servant in the main hall on the second level.  If anyones gone further then let us know whats down there :)  Massive value of loot just lying around the place because most come here just for the xp<br> however quality of loot is terrible unless youre after colour co-ordinated armour.  Huge lag here,  but that might just be my connection (I play from the UK).  Expect to see a lot of people here during peak times.  Be ready with the curses when that Tusker youre tanking starts being drained by some level 20 Mage who runs as soon as a Tusker turns on him :).  Average level of player Ive seen here is 38. <I>\t-- Laz al-Farah 6/16/2000 </i><br>There are two ramps that go down. I have only taken the one to the right, and at the bottom of that once you go down the hallway, and if your solo youll die, there is a room with an uber chest 2 virindi masters, and i think 3 or 4 guards. Safest thing is to back into a corner when in trouble if your a mage, and just start imperiling the tuskers. Once imperiled the archers and meleers jump on em.

Really efficient ruining of gaining levels with effort. Little over 30s mages running around at peak hours draining Slaves to 1/4 and then portal recall and same again. Most people dont even bother to finish off the tuskers at all - just waiting to someone else to get their attention. This dungeon is making more selfish and idiotic powerlevelers to Dereth.  <I>\t-- Finkish 6/29/2000 </i><br>Rooms are big, hallways are wide, the tuskers move about easily, and wall working is hard.  Life mages have compensated by innovating a gang work technique instead, and have prospered.

Following this a ways youll get to a big hall with alcoves on the sides of it, with tuskers in.  At the end of this hall is another ramp down with about 12 Drudge Ravs and Stalkers, and a couple of Virindi.  Theres a chest in the room with the drudges (uber I guess).  Two locked doors after this, followed by a long hallway up and an exit portal.  Why would a mage drain a slave to 1/4 and then portal out?  Who kills the tuskers then?  I never see anyone draining for 2/3 or 3/4 and running -- people kill what theyre fighting... oh well.

Three words best describes this place...TOO MANY MAGES. I spent too much time trying to find my own kills.  In the end I gave up and began kill stealing, its the only way to get the good XP everyone talks about.  My level 52 guy can easily take these tuskers on, but its a real fight trying to keep your kills.  Its no better than Qualabar Citadel and the lag is even worse (at least at the Teth BSD it is).  Mages are only after the tuskers and will flee when confronted by high level drudges and virindi. Back to OHN or Lugian Excavation for me.  Loot is much better, XP is almost the same and Mages there are very rare.  <I>\t-- prok 2/19/2001 </i><br>I dont know what everyone is smoking but I am lvl 38 mage and with my draining and my lvl 6 buffs, Tuskers are about as hard to kill as an ant.

You want a challenge, you wanna see some of the coolest battles in all of dereth? Youve come to the right place. Murk Warrens has only 2 BREEDS of monsters. Mosswarts (Feeders-Cheifs) in the first half, and Banderlings (Scouts-Ravers) in the second half. In 1st area if the dungeon, the monsters only rush in at the front (about 5-15 at a time). As you progress in the dungeon, they come in about 20 at a time, in front, and 10 rush in from the back. Oh, and remember that the respawn time is 2 mins, so alot of times, as you kill 1 wave, another wave will spawn behind you. I didnt know my way around too well, because it is dark, and so is my monitor (it REALLY REALLY sucks), but when you get to a locked door in the mosswart area, DO NOT GO IN FOR GODS SAKE. There are about 10 moss cheifs and 50+ other mosswarts that will rush out as you open it. Besides that, when you are fighting that group, youll get side rushed by a group down another hallway. There is also a room in the banderling area with the same situation, but diffrent look. Just look for the locked doors. This place IS NOT reccomended for mages =P. I know because I am one (lvl 22 all schools mage), and I went with a group of Melee fighters. If your a mage, stay in back and cast de-buffs on the stronger guys and heal, & infuse stamina on your allys. If you waste mana using war spells, your done for because theyll start to rush YOU. If your in a group, make sure all the melee fighters are lvl 20-35. Mages can be any level (we had lvl 11, 17, 21, 24, and 32 melee fighers, and me, as a lvl 15 mage). <I>\t-- Al-Tuvah 8/8/2000 </i><br>The dungeon is new school with heroic physical dimensions and spawn rate.

Oh, and if youve read this far, I should mention that the entire area is pretty well-stocked with mattekars (white, snowy, and great), golems (limestone, ice, and sandstone), bronze armordillos, and the occasional party of high-end banderlings and monougas. Mites are relatively uncommon, but are usually sentries and squibs. Shadows are rare. Good place to hunt solo for motes, hides, horns, and portals. Warning: since the June patch, diamond golems have appeared a few times, always near other golems. <I> -- jgreely</i><br>Excuse me, thats what used to be high-end banderlings<br> dont worry, they aint the vicious new spell-casters that haunt the Dires. <I>\t-- jgreely 6/19/2000 </i>"

If you are travelling on the road you will not see the sentrys until you are caught in a crossfire of quarrels fired from behind the protection of roadside bushes.

      "description": "Approximate location of Aerfalle Keep dungeon portal, spawns during the Aerlinthe Isle Quest.  Discovered by One Man Army of FrostFell.  Main Gate is locked and requires lockpick skill.  Known to be the home of the powerful undead, Lady Aerfalle.  When killed she drops a key to the chest upstairs in her room and a note regarding the shadow wars.  <I> -- The Spectre   8/24/2000  </i><br><br><br>No Recall, No Tie Portal.  Beware the Level 7 Dispell Trap between the first two doors.  Full of Relic Bones, Diamond Golems, Umbris Shadows, Firestorms, Cursed Wisps and Rats.  With the quest update during From the Darkness Born  this dungeon now has 2 level breaks.  In order to get the Recall Scroll, you MUST give the Sacrifical Dagger from Aerlinthe Reservor to The Ghost of Galaeral who is inside this dungeon.  He is located near the start on the right side near the exit portal and is behind a lever door.  The Dagger weakens Lady Aerfalle and activates the 45+ quest.  If you do not hand in the dagger, Lady Aerfalle will be the 80+ version.  In the high level version she is very dangerous and should not be taken lightly.  She dispells and casts Self protect spells if debuffed.  Lady Aerfalle has around 5000 hp and looks like a living Empyrean woman, a very mean Empyrean woman.  Use rending weapons and War to defeat her.  She will lock onto a single person, debuff them, and then beat them mercilessly.  Bring Healer Hearts, dispell gems, and a well organized group.  She also has some VOD type undead bodyguards.  Regardless, she drops around 9 keys in both 45+ and 80+ versions.  The spawn does not stop and maintains its relatively fast rate.  Run up to the chest room, minding the 2nd Level 7 Dispell Trap at its entry.  Use your key on the appropriate chest.  The 80+ Version does NOT get the recall scroll, however the items are much better than the 45+ version.  The 80+ Ashbane can be given to its old owner for 10 million XP while the 45+ Ashbane gives 500k.   <I> --Taarna Blood SC 10/13/2004 </i>"

Both rumors were entitled The Fycheck Outpost. Here are the two rumors, as written on the parchments. Fycheck was a Noble Sho warrior, known for his skill with the blade and for his being prone to wanderlust as no other Sho ever has. Indeed a great warrior, it is rumored he met his demise on a mountain plateau west of Shoushi. Hidetaki, his faithful Sifu heard of his students death and summoned warriors throughout the land to extract revenge on the creatures that caused the demise of his friend and student. Hidetakis forces were never seen alive again. As Hidetaki and his band of loyal warriors were extracting revenge on the creatures that killed the noble Fyckeck, four of the warriors panicked and fled the battlefield. After discovering a safe haven in an abandoned tower far to the south, the dishonored warriors were grief stricken that they had dishonored themselves by fleeing. Before they could commit Sepuku, to regain their honor, they were killed by a nearby wisp. Since they died with dishonor, they now haunt that tower as undead, hating the living with great passion. <I> -- Grundak</i>"

      "description": "<b>Ive replaced the lots of speculation with a dissertation done by Dereths leading Floating City Expert. Ladies and Gentlemen, without further ado I present you the savant <I>Tyr on HG<br> --  Immacolata 7/20/2003 </i></b><br> Yes this is a random dungeon, yes there are allready a billion and one entries for it <i>(edit: no more, cleaned out a kajillion of those, thanks to Doc Feelgood</i>), yes I am apolagising for entering another one, but I tried several times to add to the Floating City (Primary) thread and managed only to put in one line... so here is what I was trying to say, assuming this adds itself. There is far too much speculation and rumour on this thread, so, since I know virtually everything there is to know about the city, let me set a few things straight. Firstly, portals may now be tied and recalled to, they cant be summoned but if you see one on the landscape, tie to it, and camp it for any friends who may want to tie too (random portals only disapear when the landblock resets, so if your watching the portal it wont go anywhere). Secondly, there is no pattern to the portals appearing, they are RANDOM. Thirdly, multiple portals can spawn on the surface, the city is broken up into 8 different landblocks (7 called The Floating City, and one The Golem Sanctum), and I think all of them can be created as random landscape portals. I think the golem sanctum only spawns in the dires but I cant confirm that). Thus all these reports saying when you enter go this way are useless because it all depends on which part of the city you have entered. Now, when you enter the city, your first step is to do a /loc and work out which landblock your in, then before jumping off anything or going through any portals, check ACMaps.com which has maps of the city (done by yours truely). So far Ive only done 6, Im waiting on the random portals to take me back to the final two landblocks. That raises another point, many of the portals between the different parts of the city are random as well, which is why you should tie to the first one you found, as you may not be able to get back to explore more. Inside the city, all exit portals, and lots of the internal portals (all helpfully called just The Floating City) are random, but unlike random portals on the surface, they are allways in the same place, but every month (on patch day) they change their destination. On the maps I have made all portals are identified as either stable or random, stable portals all have a return portal next to them to facilitate two way travel. Lockpicking is not required, but does make a little more of the city accessible, it is I believe posible to get everywhere by random portals but random portals are of course random. The toughest door is resistance 322, and worth picking if you can because it leads on to a stable portal to another section. There are what apears to be two significant points of interest in the city, one is the golem sanctum, an absolute labyrinth of tightly twisting passages and more junctions than I can count, all filled with Iron golems, and at the end one obsidian with a dispell trap and a chest of crap loot. The other point of interest is something everyone should see at least once in their life, a floating advocate tower in the direlands (3.7S / 69.2W), about as high above the ground as the tou-tou lighthouse is tall, and with a bright pink energy fountain inside it. On top is a random portal to the direlands somewhere. At the begining of the Golem Sanctum is a stable portal back to the city, and a random direlands portal, I have seen these portals go to North Direlands Valley Junction, and my old favorite hunting ground North Direlands Land Bridge. During this months patch I also found a portal whos name and location I didnt write down, but the drop was so hot I died before I materialised. Shortly after that they did a server rollback and the portal changed again. Within the city you will find a number of Strained Books, which cannot be picked up but give you some interesting lore about the place, and some interesting insights into the Empyrians past. In all I would say this whole place is priety much a place only to come if you like exploring and lore, the monsters inside are for the most part, low level undead and a few banderlings, there are 2 virindi servants, and 2 revanants, and thats about it for the high level monsters. However, it does make a wonderful alternative to the Abandoned Mines as a subway, because while the portals change every month, there are a lot of exit portals and they drop you in often rare towns like Kara. A few non town portals spawn, but rarely, and all Ive noticed is Heartland which has to be one of the most common random portals (and the most boring). Anyways, Im begining to ramble on without really saying much, so I will just say that the floating city is a great place to visit, and a nice place to tie to and use as a subway (incidentally the exit portals can be tied to and summoned, so when you find a Kara portal, take a copy of it for your guild, its a nice quiet town that sells level 6 scrolls for those rich enough to afford them). Should anyone be interested in learning more, go take a look at ACMaps.coms maps and post a message on this thread, I look at it occasionally, alternatively if your on harvestgain, just tie to the city and use it to get arround, Im sure well bump into each other there (tho its never happened yet, portals in are VERY rare). <I> -- Tyr on HG  12/3/2002</i>"

You go from Mosswart Shamans on the island to suddenly being greeted by Island Dillos (lvl 38) Jungle Phyntos wasps (lvl 65) Shallows Destroyers (lvl 37?) and Shallows Devourer (lvl 50-some). I would recommend a group of at least 6 to 8 decked out level 25-30 people to even attempt this dungeon. Be ready for some serious tanking. The dillos and destroyers are immensely painful. I went in here with 3 lvl 26+ Melees and we got wasted hard, I ended up with 15% vitae Personally, I feel this level restrict needs to be fixed. On the other hand, the exit portal is a great place to tie to if you are levels 10-30. its close to the lifestone as well as the new city <I>\t-- Jadok al-Siran 11/15/2000 </i><br>I got a wee bit further in (just past the wasp) and ran smack into a ghost wisp.  barely made it out alive after that with dillos spawning in front of my escape. <I>\t-- knockturn 11/18/2000 </i><br>Ugh.. Finally got to the end of this surprisingly small cave. After the Wasp, there is 1 island dillo, then 3-4 destroyers going straight followed by a brutal devoueror. TO the right was a wisp, and maybe another dillo. Both paths end a short way from the fork. Big thanks to Shemsu, and Zyrel on Frostfell for helping me finish exploring this place. <I>\t-- Adra Mar Sula 1/18/2001 </i> <br>Today I soloed the place in 10 minutes as level 29. High melee defense helps a lot in here. Beautiful but disappointingly small. <I>\t-- Immacolata 3/22/2001 </i>"

In the lever room the Putrid Moarsman with the key is on the other side of a fence. You can kill him but unless your lucky you wont be able to loot it through the fence. This lever will open the south door on the 2nd level. Go through the south door and down one level and you will find a room with 2 levers.

The Lyceum as it is commonly called, was founded by Exarch Hieromancer Sephrena Mirenndae, who later became Priestess of the Adjanite Sisterhood of Ithaenc.  This will be your destination if you are on the Mage Armor quest.  I would suggest Level 60+ for this place.<br>The Lyceum is on the top of a sheer cliff and can only be reached by using a Lyceum Recall Gem (which you must construct).  It is no recall, so dont die. One of the gem components is on a week long timer.  After you construct and use a Lyceum Recall Gem, you will be transported to a safe area within the Lyceum.  The friendly NPC golem Eaushi the Trainer is there to greet you.  Do as he asks and you will receive crystals.  Give them to him for the uncharged mage armor.  You can also give him a Blue Orb from the Heiromancer Halls and you will be rewarded with the Globe of Aubrean orb.  Or you can give him a Sunstone Geode, a very rare random drop on the Nephol Golems within the Lyceum, for a Heiromancer orb.<br>The entire complex is very interesting and worthy of a look.  There is a cooking dress in one of the locked chests in a building.  The guard golems hold a key to this.  There is also a Lightweight Tome hidden in the library at the mountain peak.  Although this tome is suprisingly heavy, it can be written in.  You can get outside by using a lever or jumping over the wall.  If you have a low jump you may need a friend to stay at the lever in order for you to get back in.  If not, you may be able to jump from the hillside and clear the wall.  Whatever you do, dont fall off.  You may lose your corpse forever. <I> -- Taarna Blood SC </i><br><br><br></i>"

Kill the lich in the first, run up inside the thing and hit the lever. Then run inside the second and kill the undead (run inside to get them to spawn) it will open 3rd tower door. Run inside there and kill the undead that spawn outside. Kill the lesser LAST or the quest may break (and youll PISS OFF alot of people).

You can leave your guy in that last chamber where he spawns and come back every 5 hours if you want to get a bunch of Yucky Keys (4 pulls per key). I recommend doing the chests when theres a few people around, 1 is uber weapons/armor/jewelry/clothes/wands/gems/etc., one is uber weapons/armor and the other is crap. Usually if you go there at hours when a decent amount of people inside there will be a few to tell you which chests are which. All in all its a pretty easy quest if you know what your doing, but if you run ahead and start hitting traps and spawn too many critters (especially in the last section) youll get yourself and others killed. @tell me if you need help.  <I> -- Ken the Feeble</i> Either play the tower lever-pull game, or more simply, wait for the Lesser Acolyte to spawn (every 15 min.)in front of the towers, and kill him for a portal to appear for access to the dungeon. Dungeon is split into three sections, first section is Zombies, second is Skeleton Captains and the last by Liches. Creatures appear on spawn traps. You trigger the trap, and the creature spawns. Most traps are in the corners of rooms and hallways, but not always. At the end of each section is a Lesser Acolyte that you must kill to make a portal appear to access the next section. Lesser Acolytes improve in level the further you go, until the last one which is level 48. Sadly, I did not loot each acolyte as I went, apparently they have the keys for the 4 chests in the room that have lockpick resistance of 9999. SIKs do not work on said chests. There is also a lousy chest on the west wall that gives crud. Great looking dungeon, lots of neat light effects. Entered by Grundas the Dark <I> 8/8/2000 </i><br>An arrangement of 3 towers, each with buttons and/or levers on the inside. The button/lever in one tower opens the door to another tower. Ooodles of little trigger steps<br> entire dungeon quest would be fun for a few mid-levellers, alas, the run to get to this spot is not mid-level at all. <I> -- Garfield3d</i><br>VERRY important note, when nabbing the 4-use yucky key from te high acolyte at the end and hoping the portal to the chest room, you be be MUCH hapier if do NOT use the key on the 2 chests that are on the same wall together. Those 2 chests have TERRIBLE loot compared to the other two, which par with Uber Chests. Be sure to juts wait out the 15 minute spawn on the chest on the bench and the one to its left, youll thank me later. <I>\t-- Sargonas 8/13/2000 </i><br>THE safest way to get there : go to Qalabar, take the road that goes south, follow it till it ends, then stay on the serpentine forested hill, it goes to the bottom in a gentle slope. Once there, just follow the valley to the Towers. Youll find some Tumeroks, Mattekars and low level Drudges and Skeletons. Its a little longer, but that way its a mid-level quest. I made the trip with my 10th level mage, without any problems <br>-) <I>\t-- Jestra of MT 8/18/2000 </i><br>The chests are on a 5 minute spawn, not 15.  Also, to confirm the 2 chests on the East wall have really bad loot.. they DO.  The North chest is mainly wands/gems/clothing, while the West chest is mainly armor/weapons.  The North chest HAS given some GREAT helms though.  All in all a great quest.  Fun for 1st timers too, who have no idea whats going on. :) <I>\t-- Dorn Axehaft MT 9/5/2000 </i><br>Ok heres the real correct info on acolyte towers....first of all I need to say its a 7 minute spawn on chests as well as high acolyte.This quest can be done every 5 hours...when you get to the final room there will 2 pairs of 2 liches that spawn as you head towards acolyte the spawn is activated by floor traps...after the liches do NOT enter room solo...unless you can handle it.You can sucessfully stand at the very end of the hallway with out triggering acolyte or liches and buff up for the battle but watch your back people coming behind you will with any regards to you trigger the spawn(I speak from experience here)There are also individuals who will attempt to kill you at this spot(at least on hg)The west chest spawns armor and weapons of various qualities from UBER to UBER CRAP.The north spawns jewelry wands gems and the occasional armor weapons spawns here are usually AWESOME and in my opinion worth the wasted pulls to get that one good one...The best way to get here to my knowledge is to head west from Qalabar then follow beach (northern edge)when you get to the equitarial axis stop and put lightning protects on if you got them~hehe and run like the wind.There is a LS here and i recommend using it.One other important note:There are some people who enjoy disabling the dungeon and then stay in the area...in order to reset(fix) the acolytes spawn to enter the area must be cleared for 15 minutes for the land block to reset...That mean totally cleared the best way to accomplish this is just to log off for 15 minutes...1st and 2nd lvls are cake 3rd gets tough but if you can handle 2-3 liches at a time solo I recommend coming here best chests in the game... <I>\t-- Krack of HG 9/9/2000 </i><br>Definitely follow the coast. I went through one of the valleys headed west and saw shadow lieutenants, berserker and striker banderlings and a few other high level baddies. <I>\t-- Mothgog  9/30/2000 </i><br>The south coast route has spawn points which can produce Bone Knights and Bone Lords<br> Ive heard the north coast route is better.\t <I>\t-- Red and Gold 10/6/2000 </i><br>Just follow any coast. =) Spawns are random and you could see Armoredillos to Shadows to Bone Lords. Even by taking the North shore, you have to cross back South through dangerous land since the towers lie in close proximity to the Southern shore. Run fast, keep your mini-map open... <I>\t-- Garfield3d 10/9/2000 </i><br>The Acolyte towers are actually due south of 87.6S 10.6W. All three towers are visible from these coordinates. <I>\t-- Slyzzr 11/25/2000 </i><br>Most of the previous posts are crap...  The real scoop is that the end of this simple quest are chests that are lootable 4 times with the yucky(lucky) key.  For an added bonus you also get a skull worth 12,000 exp to an ivory crafter(great to save these for quick vitae burners).  The problem is choosing the right chests at the end to open.  The chest positions in the room change constantly(previous posts telling what ones are good are worthless posts).  Out of the 4 chests 2 are uber loot.  1 contains primarily weapons/armor and the other contains magic items like wands and jewelry.  The best approach to finding the right chests is to either save your keys until you show up in the chest room with someone that has already located the uber chests or go with another adventurer so at most you both only waste one try with your key.  Note: Unless you are lvl 40+ or you have a nice size party I would suggest staying just outside high acolyte room and draw him out with ranged attacks or spells(evil presence is the killer in the room not the acolyte).  My technique is to cast imperil 4 on the high acolyte to where I can 1 time him with ease when he charges me and leaves his room.  The ONLY drawback to this quest is that you can only do it every 5 hrs.  Another note...  The spawn rate for the high acolyte is only around 4-5 minutes.  BTW another nice technique to conque</i>"

The entrance area is safe. All you need to do is head down the hallways either running past the pairs of beaten and battered dolls or killing them. You will also meet the occasional narrow rift. You will come to a large area that you must jump over - be warned if you do not make the jump you drop into a caged area from which there is no way out except to recall. Continue down after the jump till you finally reach the caged area where the virindi that has the quest item spawns outside of the cage. The dungeon is more for a mid level player as I soloed this easily at lvl45. Loot is fair to poor.

I have been sent here by the Arcanum to provide Writs of Refuge in return for various items needed to prepare for any coming turmoil that threatens the Isparian presence here on Ispar.  Nuhmudira has informed us that creatures of old may soon be stalking the earth.  And these creatures hold items of value.  Items that we can use.  If you come across a Crest of the Falatacot, a Ring of Mummified Skin, or a Quiddity Crystal, I am able to exchange a Writ of Refuge for any one of these items.  What we need may change at any time, so be prepared. Agent of the Arcanum tells you, Apparently the creatures who hold these items may not be abroad in the land quite yet.  When they first appear, we shall herald their presence and repeat our warning for as long as they stalk the earth. Agent of the Arcanum tells you, Once you possess the Writ of Refuge, then you have satisfied the main requirements for acquiring a home.  The Covenant Crystals also require money and other minor items, but those items should not be in short supply.  Enjoy your homestead.  One note: Nuhmudira has set aside a small number of palatial estates for those allegiances thought to be most worthy of their ownership, and the most generous with their resources.

First there be Tusker Guards and virindi puppets. Then servants and masters. At the bottom you meet Rampagers, Tumideon Minions and the Director, plus a gang of Masters guarding the Pillar room. The Director drops a Directors Mask. The respawn rate is maddeningly fast, about 2 seconds, and I have spotted many corpses down here already. Mages stick to the rampagers, and meleers make sure to take out them rickety but hard hitting tumideons fast. The antechamber to the pillar room is narrow and will be place for heavy battles. It is possible for a person to break out of the fight, run across the room down ramp and into the pillar room unscathed. In here you can either dash further down and hide at the exit portals, or run up-ramp to the pillars (ramps are at the left and right at the end of the room). You can perch this place in relative safety. The entry portal cant be tied to, but the surface portal can be. <I> -- Immacolata</i><br>This is a good place to level up on Tusker/Virindi. The antechamber to the sliver room is very difficult to negotiate: Guards and Rampagers will block the narrow entrance corridor three deep, and lag will pop heroes in and amongst them, but not let them run through in an orderly way.  Luring the mob out of the antechamber is unpredictable -- they often get stuck on each other.  <I> -- Doc Feelgood 12/11/2001 </i><br>Level cap removed.

In his jealousy, the anima Carenzi has infested the beautiful shrine I built for Raeta with his own creatures.

Basically, the bug caused them to go to the top of the monster's hate list. Wi called it the Wi flag, and I got him to autograph my healer's heart in-game on Frostfell just before he quit the game.

They resist my 349 life magic almost all the time, and my 383 war pretty darn often. And I hit for 20-30 pts. Slashing seemed to work better. Baning all 4 elements seems to be a good idea. One of the therals at the bottom drops a Ring of a Singularity Key. Pick this up and get to next dungeon, Venomous Nidus, for 2nd part of the key. <I> -- Immacolata</i>"

In a desert region, I came upon a suspended walkway hung out from the edge of a cliff.  The other end of the walkway was attached not to solid ground but was lost in the spinning light of a portal.  I held my breath and stepped upon the walkway, half expecting it to collapse and throw me to the ground so far below. Yet, the walkway held my weight.  I crept forward and stepped through the portal.  I arrived on another walkway, or perhaps the same one somehow extended through the portal.  There was a platform at its far end, then another walkway... Well, it is something you must see for yourself.  Suffice it to say that I journeyed through this structure, all the while being assailed by vile creatures. Near the top of this construction I spied an artifact- a tall pedestal it was, with arcane shapes gyrating in the air above it. I know not its function but it was clear to me that this artifact, this device, is of some import. There are many things it could be and none, I believe, of small consequence. Before I was able to reach it, a wretched monster sent me back to my Lifestone.  Later, I attempted to return, yet the portal would not permit me to pass. I know not why.\"\"<br>Slithe Tradittor tells you, \"\"I must study this device. I call it the \"\"Arcane Pedestal.\"\" I even believe I have the means to create a version of it, but first I require an imprint of its morphology.\"\"<br>Slithe Tradittor tells you, \"\"I shall give you a copy of my notes and an Imaging Crystal. The notes show you the way to that place. The Imaging Crystal can be imprinted with the composition and design of this device.  Return to me with the imprint embedded within the Crystal and I will study it and determine how to create it.\"\"<br>Slithe Tradittor tells you, \"\"The Arcane Pedestal.  We shall have the Arcane Pedestal.\"\" <I> -- Astalon Decurth</I><br>This is the start point for the June 2002 \"\"Arcane Pedestal & Map of Dereth\"\" Quest.

      "description": "Yes this is a random dungeon, yes there are allready a billion and one entries for it, yes I am apolagising for entering another one, but I tried several times to add to the Floating City (Primary) thread and managed only to put in one line... so here is what I was trying to say, assuming this adds itself. There is far too much speculation and roumour on this thread, so, since I know virtually everything there is to know about the city, let me set a few things straight. Firstly, portals may now be tied and recalled to, they cant be summoned but if you see one on the landscape, tie to it, and camp it for any friends who may want to tie too (random portals only disapear when the landblock resets, so if your watching the portal it wont go anywhere). Secondly, there is no pattern to the portals apearing, they are RANDOM. Thirdly, multiple portals can spawn on the surface, the city is broken up into 8 different landblocks (7 called The Floating City, and one The Golem Sanctum), and I think all of them can be created as random landscape portals. I think the golem sanctum only spawns in the dires but I cant confirm that). Thus all these reports saying when you enter go this way are useless because it all depends on which part of the city you have entered. Now, when you enter the city, your first step is to do a /loc and work out which landblock your in, then before jumping off anything or going through any portals, check ACMaps.com which has maps of the city (done by yours truely). So far Ive only done 6, Im waiting on the random portals to take me back to the final two landblocks. That raises another point, many of the portals between the different parts of the city are random as well, which is why you should tie to the first one you found, as you may not be able to get back to explore more. Inside the city, all exit portals, and lots of the internal portals (all helpfully called just The Floating City) are random, but unlike random portals on the surface, they are allways in the same place, but every month (on patch day) they change their destination. On the maps I have made all portals are identified as either stable or random, stable portals all have a return portal next to them to facilitate two way travel. Lockpicking is not required, but does make a little more of the city accessible, it is I believe posible to get everywhere by random portals but random portals are of course random. The toughest door is resistance 322, and worth picking if you can because it leads on to a stable portal to another section. There are what apears to be two significant points of interest in the city, one is the golem sanctum, an absolute labyrinth of tightly twisting passages and more junctions than I can count, all filled with Iron golems, and at the end one obsidian with a dispell trap and a chest of crap loot. The other point of interest is something everyone should see at least once in their life, a floating advocate tower in the direlands (3.7S / 69.2W), about as high above the ground as the tou-tou lighthouse is tall, and with a bright pink energy fountain inside it. On top is a random portal to the direlands somewhere. At the begining of the Golem Sanctum is a stable portal back to the city, and a random direlands portal, I have seen these portals go to North Direlands Valley Junction, and my old favorite hunting ground North Direlands Land Bridge. During this months patch I also found a portal whos name and location I didnt write down, but the drop was so hot I died before I materialised. Shortly after that they did a server rollback and the portal changed again. Within the city you will find a number of Strained Books, which cannot be picked up but give you some interesting lore about the place, and some interesting insights into the Empyrians past. In all I would say this whole place is priety much a place only to come if you like exploring and lore, the monsters inside are for the most part, low level undead and a few banderlings, there are 2 virindi servants, and 2 revanants, and thats about it for the high level monsters. However, it does make a wonderful alternative to the Abandoned Mines as a subway, because while the portals change every month, there are a lot of exit portals and they drop you in often rare towns like Kara. A few non town portals spawn, but rarely, and all Ive noticed is Heartland which has to be one of the most common random portals (and the most boring). Anyways, Im begining to ramble on without really saying much, so I will just say that the floating city is a great place to visit, and a nice place to tie to and use as a subway (incidentally the exit portals can be tied to and summoned, so when you find a Kara portal, take a copy of it for your guild, its a nice quiet town that sells level 6 scrolls for those rich enough to afford them). Should anyone be interested in learning more, go take a look at ACMaps.coms maps and post a message on this thread, I look at it occasionally, alternatively if your on harvestgain, just tie to the city and use it to get arround, Im sure well bump into each other there (tho its never happened yet, portals in are VERY rare).

Enter through the portal in his basement and marvel at the amazing array of decorations on the walls and floors, probably the most impressively decorated place in all of AC.  Some of the items are recognizeable, some arent, some are unusual (like Ulgrims vast collection of monster heads), and some are just silly (like the Holy Handgrenade of Antioch, specially imbued with the Rabbit Slayer property).  This dungeons worth seeing just for the decorations, if nothing else.<br>There are many items to get in this dungeon, the primary one being the Home Brew.  Take the Home Brew to Ulgrim (dont drink it -- 14 day timer.) and hell give you the Casting Stein that has a mana C bonus of 7% and also casts Stam to Mana IV.  While killing your way through the dozens of tiny white and brown mice (which respawn like crazy and have extremely high attack skill, even though they do little damage), youll randomly find a Golden Key, which unlocks all the locked chests and doors in the basement.  All locked chests and doors are easily pickable, as well, so the key is not necessary for LP characters.  They also sometimes drop a block of cheese, which is ironic as its 50 times the size of the mouse carrying it.<br>The Golden Key can be used on either of Ulgrims storage chests, in which one can find the Hangover Cure, an Ust, Stout, Winter Lager, and Peppermint sticks.  Alternately it can be used to unlock the Treasure Room door which is hidden behind a wall of tapestries near the storage chests.  Behind the Treasure Room Door is a room full of glittering piles of Treasure (worth 200k and hookable on floor hooks -- 28 day timer), a Golden Gromnie inscribed by Ulgrim (no timer, but unusable for purchasing mansions), and a Lock Box that contains a simple gold ring inscribed by Ulgrim with the message Lo Bnaseuim (28 day timer).<br>Upon returning to Ulgrim, you can give him almost any item found in his dungeon and hell say funny and witty things, most notably doing his Gollum impersonation when you give him the gold ring.  Also, if you give him the Peppermint sticks, hell give you a Peppermint Pumpkin Pie that drains 20 points of stamina when eaten. <I> -- Confucius of FF</i>"

The first is a Lockpick trial which requires you to have LP and have it buffed pretty high (300+) or else it will drain away your health. The 2nd is a room full of rolling balls of death with wood platforms hovering above... you must jump from one to the other without falling or youll die and your corpse will be 100% unrecoverable. The 3rd is a room with a target on one end, you on the other, and a lava pit between. Use a bow, xbow, or wand to strike the target with a critical hit. The last room is a rather difficult logic puzzle, which might possibly be bugged (4 of us did it and our answer we all arrived at separately was wrong). Look it up online and avoid a lot of frustration :) Solving this takes you to a room with the new Oswalds Dirk, possibly in a pickable chest... I didnt make it this far because of the bugged puzzle, so I might be wrong on where it is. No word on where the lost husband really is, though, or why Ulgrims acting so guilty. -- Confucius of FF <I> -- Doc Feelgood</i><br>Entrance is mildly hot. Dungeon itself has nothing to fight -- its a jump-and-puzzle dungeon. If you fail the first room puzzle and survive, heal up and try again, theres no timer on trying the puzzle.

Just entering this dungeon flags you as ready for the follow-on quest, Heart of Innocence, and there you learn the lost husbands fate. <I> -- Doc Feelgood 8/9/2003 </i>"

The portal cannot be summoned, and has no level restriction anymore.<br>The following is copy and pasted from the old entry for Carved Caves.  If this is already here, forgive me, it didnt come up with a Search.<br>Near Stonehold.  Last key in quest for the SoLL is found in chest at the bottom.  MANY monsters.<br>Now lvl 17+<br>has lots of monugas, a few skels and some shadows at the bottom -- Ki Dung Sa Bong 10/18/99<br>Near the end where you find a key .. green portal to Direlands .. -- Frescobaldi 12/20/99<br>Main chamber with the SoLL key is guarded by 3 Shadow children up front and 3 Shadows near the chest containing the key.  Portals to Qalabar and Midland Direlands in the same chamber. Portal to Direlands sends you to a lifestone near the middle of the southern coast.  Portal to Hebian-to is nearby. -- Farouk 1/26/00<br>Addition:  Level 15 for Westward Portal to Carved Caves, Level 17 to get into Carved Caves, Level 21 to take portal at bottom to mid-Direlands.  Portal restricting at its finest.  -- Doc Feelgood 2/6/00<br>Does anyone know how to get there? -- Lost & Confused 3/12/2000<br>You need to get carved keys to get down to the Soll key - once youve found the 2nd surface portal, your virtually on top of the shadows. Theres also a chest, that req a sturdy iron key with the Skeletons in the Monouga Gallery - 30/6/00 -- Typhoid V 6/30/2000<br>The chest with Sturdy Iron Key spawns level V scrolls. Useless since SplitPea.  -- Nekorkhan (MT) 7/9/2000<br>Note that the portal cannot be tied to nor summoned. Tie to the Murk Warrens, about 8 clicks away, instead. You can reach the surface portal of that dungeon (just take a right) without fighting. At the Carved Caves, be ready for the Shadows in the end. Be careful, or they may draw you into the Qalabar portal. You will definitely want to take the Direlands portal from this dungeon to reach the Halls of Lost Light.  -- Wylfghar 12/28/2001  <I>-- Solan Thommad 1/17/2004</i>"

The level breaks are 40-69, 70-99, and 100+   Puzzles and trials lead to the High Matriarch Ixir Zi.  One of your felowship members must be the Victim who uses the 4 Eyes to bring the Matriarch out.  The Eyes massively debuff the Victim and continually drain them.  I believe the draining only starts when they have 0 stamina.  I strongly suggest that the victim logs out for the duration of the battle.  They have 15 minutes to rejoin and will be much safer.  Make sure to have a couple people wait in the Boss room to refellow and Heal the victim.  Send the rest of the people into the reward room to battle the few Burun present.  Afterward your Victim may enter, but make sure that they wait out the debuffs before getting their reward.  The Sarcophagus casts a drain spell as it gives you the Ancient Armored Vestment.

I barely escaped here to safety of Redspire in one piece. Fortunately my dear friend Micon has agreed to give me shelter until I am back upon my feet.<br><br>Bachus Flufens tells you, They must hold that relic in high esteem indeed. A most fanciful folk, I must say. I heard that it is a legendary spear that they dismantled and enshrined in two separate caverns on the island. It once belonged to a warrior from an opposite faction, I believe. He tried to persuade them back to traditional ways, but they would have none of it. Somehow they dispatched him but retained his spear...which is supposed to have some sort of magical, living properties to it. Im not quite sure what to believe.<br><br>Bachus Flufens tells you, Perhaps the answer could be found in the caverns to the northwest along the shore.  Try the area around 40.2N 84.7W --at least thats where I saw the Tumeroks heading last. Beware, friend--its quite likely to be well guarded. Id go myself, but I must catch up on my journal today.

There is an unmarked Insatiable Eater there.  It has the Jaw and you even get a helpful message when you kill it.  The timer is 21 days.   <I>-- Taarna Blood 7/7/2005</I>The jaw can also be turned in for 40 million xp, 2 MMD notes, and a title token for the title Insatiable Slayer. <I>-- Chupon 7/22/2005</I>"

This is the place where Geowulf the Stonehearted got lost and killed.   Branwyn, his greiving wife, is found near Arwic.  Take the wedding ring you find inside back to Branwyn for a great ring with Major Healing and Major Flame Ward on it.  It also has a run and regen spell.  Give this ring to Harlune the Misanthrope in Mite Maze and he will upgrade it.  You will also find 3 pieces of Geowulf's Journal on the ground.  These are worth 8-16 million XP each if given to Branwyn.<br><br><br><br>At the end you will find Xik Minru.  She has 50k HP and is rather nasty.  You have to turn in an artifact to get her to spawn.  Various types are found on the undead around the temple.  Upon killing her you will get a key and a book.  The book is worth XP and the key opens a chest for dye that will allow you to dye your Blackmire quest armor. <I>-- Taarna Blood SC 10/19/2005</I>"
