The entrance portal is guarded on the south and the west by Banderling Scouts and Young Banderlings as well as Green Phyntos Wasps, Outcast Monouga, Mite Snippets, and a few Shreth...  Inside, there are essentially 3 levels... the level you enter into has two or three Drudge Skulkers (lvl 2), one Drudge Slinker (lvl 4), and one Outcast Monouga...  This entry level also has a stamina fountain in the middle of it, but there are no chests and loot is minimal...  On the lower level (that is, down the ramp from the entry level), there are three Outcasts all gathered in one chamber, and a looped hallway that goes from one end of the chamber, behind the chamber, and to the other end of the chamber... in the hall are two Gnawer Shreths...  On this level of the dungeon there are also no chests, though I don't know about loot because I ran in, looked around, and left without killing anything...  On the upper level (that is, up the ramp from the entry level) there is a long hall with several side chambers (six I think)... all but one or two of those chambers have enemy creatures in them, and those creatures are usually in groups of 2-4 creatures...  There are mostly Drudge Sneakers (lvl 4 I think), but one of the chambers has two Outcasts and a chest...  only About half of these chambers have doors, so expect to get swarmed a bit...  The chest that I mentioned has low level cloths, and a little food...  At the end of the hall on this level, there is a locked gate (I have not yet found a key), and behind it there is a very small cavity with a single Drudge Sneaker and a chest... since I haven't found a key and I don't have a very good Lock Picking skill (only level 35), and since I haven't been able to kill everything on the level, I haven't been able to get into the chest or even through the door... in fact, I died three times trying before I gave up and decided I need to wait and go in with a group...  I recomend never going into this dungeon before level three, and only with at least one other person, unless you plan to stay on the bottom two levels...  When I have more info about the chest on the upper level, I will add it. <I>	-- ANM 3/28/2001 </I><br>OK, I finally was able to open the locked gate on the top level (I used lockpick with a ""Reliable Lockpick"") and got into the chest (on the second attempt... after the first time, I died right before I got into the chest)...  This dungeon is not worth the trouble...  The chest contained all of 9 pyreals...  All this dungeon is worth is exp, and even that can be better recieved in other places...  Don't bother with this dungeon... ever. <I>	-- ANM 3/28/2001 </I>

As run up with the key to the lower level, there are 6 players waiting for somebody to open the door for them. The real sad thing is that several of them already had the damn ""jolly green giant"" armor on already. I just picked up the loot on the floor found my self encumbered and left. Sorry I didn't need to wait several hours for the armor. <I>	-- ~Confucious 2/4/00 </I><br>The Green Mire Cuirass is a set of Green Yori armor that is great for characters of any class for use until well into their 20?s if they wish. It covers upper, and lower body. It is located in the Green Mire Grave not far from Shoushi. This is an adventure for characters of at least level 12 in a group, or level 18+ solo. From Shoushi head to the Lifestone at 25.7 S 74.8 E. There is also a house here that is safe to rest in, if you have been injured by the area?s nasties. From here head to the dungeon location at 27.8 S 71.7 E about a 3 minute real time run. The portal is surrounded by several pillars of stone. Inside you will find your self in a large room with 4 exits, and 4 surface portals. Through 1 exit you can get to the Green Mire Yari (see that quest) from another you can get to the Green Mire Cuirass. ****** WARNING****** The next section contains SPOILERS do not read this if you want to discover the dungeon on your own. Ok, you have been warned. For the Cuirass head to the West exit. Stick to the wall on your left until you come to an opening to your right with stairs down. The 2nd opening I think. Go down. When you get to the 4-way intersection go left to the end of the hall. There will be a door here to be picked. Not too hard. As you descend the stairs you will encounter several different Mosswarts. Barkers, Feeders, and Mudlurks. At the bottom the hall will turn left. There is a large room here. At the far end is a chest, with some minor magical traps on it. This is where the Cuirass pops. The chest is pickable, but for those of you, who can not pick, the Mosswart Chief drops the key to the chest. In either corner of the room pops Mosswart Shamans. They can cast some nasty spells, and for the lower level adventurer this can be deadly. Also, there is a stone arch. This is where a Ghost Wisp pops. The cycle is about 30 min. All monster, except the Wisp will pop 2X before the next chest pop. When you see the Wisp pop, that is the sign that the Cuirass has popped. Vylarn Monarch of the Elite Brotherhood Harvestgain. <I>	-- Vylarn 5/10/2000 </I><br>The place is soooooooo crowded.  Forget the Curias, just pick up all the loot everyone else isn't intersted in.  I make from 15-30k a run. <I>	-- Bleys Icefalcon 5/23/2000 </I><br>when u get to the intersection it is right not left <I>	-- lighting strike 9/23/2000 </I><br>The correct directions for the Green Mire Cuirass: From the entrance, head west.  Take first left. Take first right. at the crossroads take a right, not a left.  Follow to a locked door and pick it. Follow beyond the dorr to the room with the chest. <I>	-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 </I><br>Key for the West wing door is located in the north wing on a barker moswart. <I>	-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 </I><br>I have also found a red key that says it goes to 'a prison door in the Green Mire Grave'. <I>	-- Hexxor 12/31/2000 </I><br>If you dont have lock pick here is what you do.  From the entrance, head North into the dead end section, kill the barker mosswart, grab his key.  Go back to entrance area, head East until you reach an area with a locked door going upstairs.  Use the key you just got off the barker and head on in.  This area leads further upstairs until you reach the grave area, which is the highest point of the dungeon.  You can get the prison cell key off the low level mosswart (its redish).  Return to the entrance area then head South.  The southern area is small, 2 low lev mosswarts and a few drudges.  In the drudge area, you get the prison cell chest key off the big drudge.  After heading back to the entrance, head West. Take a left on the first fork in the hall, then make an immediate right heading downwards. At the 4 way crossroad, make left, kill the 2 mosswarts and use the red key to open up the prison cell.  Use the key you got off the drudge to open the chest.  Inside the chest is a key that opens the BIG door that leads downstairs and all of its medium level baddies.  Once downstairs, you must kill the Chief mosswart in order to get the key that opens the chest which gives you the Green Mire armor. To open the chest in the upstairs section (East from entrance) you need to kill a mosswart in the West/Upstairs section.  Cant miss him, he has a barker and shamen to keep him company. NOTE: This place can often be camped by high level monarchs obtaining easy armor for their vassels.  <I>	-- prok 1/3/2001 </I><br>NOTE:This dungeon is allmost allways camped by everyone all of the time.Expect to wait for many hours for the armor during peak hours.and you can forget about getting the yari.if you come at midnight there might not be anyone around but you better be able to solo everything from the weakest mosswarts all the way up to the mosswart cheif and the wisp that guards the chest with the armor.unless your level 20 or 30+ then your screwed no matter what. <I>	-- Sega Slayer 3/24/2001 </I><br>heh...now everyhting I said in my last post is innaccurate.

If possible, come here at lvl 15 (the lvl limit).  There are so many cheap spots among the granites, and once you can take them out easily, the magmas wait below.  In the entrance room, 3 granites spawn across from you, to left and right will be 2 portals.  Get up next to the wall between the portal and the granites, a bit closer to the portal, and use life magic to kill all granies without them being able to get to you.  Go down into a room with a chandelier.  Take the center hallway from there.  There you see a little V shape split.  Lure guys here, run on opp side of V from them, and more easy XP.  Also, granites cant run underneath the chandelier if you lure them up there.  Copper golems can however.  Next take a right.  There will be 1 granite right there, lure him out, and kill him.  Now you can go in, turn left, and get next to the wall.  From there you can hit the granite who, if done right, is stuck against the corner.  He can still get you with magic though.  The other you can lure behind a big rock thats aroudn the corner.  If you would have taken a left up higher, you end up going towards the magmas, and after you kill the first4 granies, there is another wall u can use to hide behind. For magmas, when you jump down, run forward a small bit, and turn right towards a portal.  Go into the corner near the magma there, easy harming and draining. Go back out to main hallway and go as you were going.  A bit ahead, near a lot of magmas, there is a ramp to your right, sit on the ramp for more easy XP. <I>	-- Flamelord 1/5/00 </I><br>Life magic sucks :-] <I>	-- Nightwolf 2/1/00 </I><br>I agree withthe Above statement.

There are a total of 8 chances per spawn, if you manage to kill the 4 coppers, 3 irons, and the obsidian and leave nothing behind for anybody else.  The mote spawn here ranges from poor to excellent.  Don't bother with granites if you only want motes, but sometimes they just get.  Nice place to power level and work on a quest at the same time. <I>	-- Xcalibur 3/27/2000 </I><br>Cool place for Mages who like to power-level by draining.  Virtually solely populated by the said Life Mages with only the occasional warrior or archer to be seen.  Creatures have been described above but the danger wasn't really emphasised :)  The very bottom is huge and spawns lots of Magmas.  Good fun draining them if that's what you like, but at the same time you're slowly taking damage from the heat down there.  And in response to a previous poster, the magmas now know their life spells :)  - they now drain you :).  Also home to Flares (lvl 12?), Flammas (lvl 43?) and Infernos (lvl 121).  Flares and Flammas are no problem to 25+ Mages, the Infernos are a different matter :).  Crap loot except for the occasional black rock from the magmas, black stone from the obsidian above or the even more occasional spawning mote from everything bar the Granites. A previous poster mentioned dropping down to the Magmas at level 15; well unless you've got someone with you who can dump a yield on them (at least IV) I wouldn't bother... my life is 240 and I still get resist, resist, resist :) If you want to practice on the Fire Elementals (Flare/Flamma/Inferno) before you go down then look no further than the Crater Lake :), just get ready to run from the Inferno, he hurts. <I>	-- Laz al-Farah 4/27/2000 </I><br>Sturdy iron key opens chest at bottom <I>	-- Shoto Fle-Alch 5/7/2000 </I><br>You can access the crater via a passage on the rim on its southwest side.  The passage is guarded by one (or two) groups of a Flamma and two Flares and is visibly marked by tall columns on both the entrance and exit sides.  Trying to jump in elsewhere can get you killed (even with 170 health..). <I>	-- Tell of William 7/6/2000 </I><br>They changed the bottom of this place in the July 2000 patch.  No uber chests down there now; the chests remain open, they don't even need picking.  The spawn of Magmas in the very bottom has been reduced considerably.  Where this was once an open area with a large lava pit in it, it is now populated with lots of small hut type structures which could be forges.  Next to one of the forges is a set of Pyreal Forge Bellows.  These are no drop, but I have no idea as to their use. <I>	-- Laz al-Farah 7/13/2000 </I><br>I don't know if this is just pure luck or what but I went here before June patch 2001 and got 1 SIK for about every 100 magma golems I killed.

Ive ran out of there with upto 7 of the things crying to have my body for lunch :) A network of passageways lead downwards, these passages contain nymphs (dont be deceived by their Lvl - they hit very hard), workers and soldiers.  At the very bottom is a Noble. Usually the whole dungeon is very crowded, the noble is always camped. In there youll probably see some poor warrior tanking away with the Olthoi whilst a load of Archers do their thing - I gotta admit to being one. Exit portal is in room off large room where you portal in.  No exit from the bottom which means trying to get past all the olthoi again.

Between it and Shoushi though, is a BEAUTIFUL mountain, shaped like a man from above.  <I>	-- Adren 9/18/99 </i><br>All basic stores here. Close to swamp ruin,full of mudlurks and barkers,couple shamans.  <I>	-- PizzaFiend 1/14/00 </i><br>The only reason to go to this smelly swamp town is to get blunt arrowheads, which come in handy for direlands hunting. <I> 1/19/00 </i><br>Hear, hear, one of the worst laid out places on the map.  Bad news monsters in the trackless swamps north, and a lifestone thats halfway to enternity heading south. I left two corpses in those swamps just trying to get into town from the north. <I>	-- Doc Feelgood 2/15/00 </i><br>A good reason to go here: it sells basic stock Yoroi armor for the lowest prices anywhere. For example, basic AL 80 Yoroi leggings, which cost 1788 in Mayoi and 2145 in the Hebian armorer sell here for 1645 (as of this date). Other Yoroi-type basic stock armor pieces are similarly low priced. So if you are like me and like checking out unknown areas in armor that is not a problem to lose (coming back with your good stuff once you know you can handle it), here is the place to get basic Yoroi stuff. Its also not a problem to get to...run NW from Shoushi on the road that passes the GMG. Not hard at all. <I>	-- Zimbalt 5/18/2000 </i><br>  I liked Sawato, The swamp can be a pain but there is a life stone with a Mage to thee North as well as a Mosswart Tower that holds mudlurks, barkers, and a shaman.  If you head North through the swamp and into the mountains you can find another lifestone. In the mountains there is a mosswart Chief and many other good monsters. <I>	-- MojoRisen 5/26/2000 </i><br>My opinion of Sawato has improved since my previous entry.  Lifestones are now close by both east and northwest, the mage shop has low prices, there is a trophy smith and a wing collector, I can use blunt arrowheads, and its close to the Sho Roadside exit point. <I>	-- Doc Feelgood 6/10/2000 </i><br>If you want blunt arrowheads (and you do.), this is the place to get them. <I>	-- Keef the Thief 12/8/2000 </i><br>If youre looking for plants with which to dye your armor red, the swamps to the west are a great place to find them. <I>	-- Sixfingers 12/10/2000 </i><br>The mage here now sells plat, pyreal, and gold scarabs. <I>	-- Xarion of MT 3/5/2001 </i><br>Casino nearby, It should be a boom town soon.

I have made the trip as a lvl 1 mage and it is not that difficult. Another bonus about this place is the mage tower down the beach has very low prices and is very popular with mages.  <I>	-- Laitly Crestfie 2/13/00 </i><br>Excellent hunting from level 5-20, with great transitions from lowly Drudges to Grommies and Water Golems to Amploth Lugians to even Shadow Liutenants being sighted not give minutes from town.  Spectacular beachfront property, to boot. <I>	-- anony 6/10/2000 </i><br>I would just like to note that the Prices at the mage shop are not low, bu actually rather high. For mana stones at least... <I>	-- Ganzor 6/21/2000 </i><br>The mage tower close to town has crappy prices, but the one farther down the beach south and east has decent (10% markup) prices, worth the extra 2 minute run <I>	-- Serafin 8/4/2000 </i><br>Bowyer sells Armor Piercing arrowheads.  Worth a trip if you have an alchemist/fletcher <I>	-- Jann 9/29/2000 </i><br>Good hunting but good and crowded too.

You have to go up a ramp into the throne room. Holtburg Dungeon:  Take the first left each time (a right turn might be most left option), until you see white rat(s).  One of the rats has the key. Rithwic Crypt:  Its on a white rat on the 2nd level down.  You have to open a door somewhere to get down. Dungeon Manor (Samsur).  Find the stairs down.  Go to the left I think.  There should be a hallway, with mroe stairs down into a farily large room with drudges.  One of the drudges has the key. Yaraq Tunnels: Go to bottom of dungeon (there should be a gate near stairs.

You know, all the neat things for an aspiring mage.  <I> -- Gonzo</i><br>Many dangerous Kefirs who casts Level IV+ Spells and many levers and closed doors. I opened all but didnt find anything interesting. Bad Xp and bad loot. The 2 irons are the only good xp in that dungeon.  <I>	-- StrangerX 12/21/99 </i><br>Thisplace has a sacarphagous that spawns al 139 armour... 3 item ever26 minutes. Itis SO camped and manipulated. Room at bottom of dungeon, at the last choice of turninng right or left go right (left all before that). Every one who camps is lvl 30+ so havea high quick for beating them cause they cant line up. Sandstone golemn spawns there. <I>	-- Hate Campers. 1/12/00 </i><br>Eh, lets not forget the PK alter at the bottom .. watch out, though, you can trigger a door to open, unleashing many (and I mean many) swamp rats upon you..  Also, Shadows, and more Swamp Rats.. not to mention Swamp Rats... <I>	-- Vioxide 1/18/00 </i><br> The above poster is correct, this is an amazingly good chest. The only problem is that in the last patch, they upeed its defence. Now the chest is gaurded by an iron and obsidian golem, and a level IV lightning trap. Scary for a dungeon with only a level 8 restriction. <I>	-- Togashi Kokuni 2/7/00 </i><br>Correction and Addition...  The lightning traps are lvl III, the chest is now locked, and casts imperil V when you open it.  All the REALLY good loot was in it before the patch too....  it seems to have been lowered a little.  Still good stuff tho <I>	-- Pitt 3/12/2000 </i><br>chest broken...spawns nothing... tried all day one day :(  <I>	-- George 4/23/2000 </i><br>chest now requires study iron key <I> 5/27/2000 </i><br>The chest DOES spawn good stuff, you just need one of those stupid Sturdy Iron Keys found randomly on monsters, mostly dires monsters...i found one on a silver rat and one on a Shadow Lt. <I>	-- Sword Nut 6/8/2000 </i><br>As of October patch, Sarcaphagous is now guarded by 2 Obsidian Golems. SIK does NOT open it anymore. <I>	-- Deskjet 10/15/2000 </i><br>Additonal: First off the Stone key does still open the door infront of the now 2 obsids.. which coicidently yield ZERO experience, and are not targetable using radar and creature selection keys.. you must use your mouse thru a texture or edge..   Also the sarcophagus key is found on Lord Rytheran who is still guarding the other (unchanged) sturdy iron chest.  His spawn however is OVER 1 hour long.. we were not patient enough.. only made 1 pull.. got 2-7 +7 attack BD V aluvian only dagger.. not bad for a worthless skill <br>) <I>	-- J.C. - MT 10/28/2000 </i><br>- also as expected this has a quest time.. you have completed this quest to recently.. could not pick up Lord Rytherans Key again 2 hours later. <I>	-- J.C. - MT 10/28/2000 </i><br>To reach Lord Rytheran the Cursed Key from Burial Temple is required..the back door to reach him has been removed in Oct 2000 patch. His key is no-drop and opens Lady Js tomb fka an Uber chest. Loot is still the same variety as when it was Uber chest. Lockpicker and patience required..Lord Rs spawn rate is too long..hope they change this since a group effort is really needed for this quest. See my entry at Burial Temple. Get his letter translated in Zaikhal i believe. BTW, no more campers here =). <I>	-- AllyMcAlchemist 11/1/2000 </i><br>This interesting little tweak they did to the dungean came way to late. The dungean WAS camped but only before the SIK hype calmed down.  Ive made several trips there since then and often the only ones who are there just want to attack the obbies and are glad to help you to the chest.  Making this a non SIK chest ruins it in my opinion and that spawn rate is rediculous.  The chest the last few months seems to have been spitting out items with a higher cash value than actual game function so perhaps Trialos is the place to go now... <I>	-- Rendar 1/7/2001 </i>

Mostly Ivory Gromnies, Ice Golems, and Black Rats of the top three levels.  Ran out of time before I got to the bottom.  Ice walls and ice roof looks very cool.  Worth a trip just to look. <I> -- Shogo Akai</i><br>its part of the frost quest, at the very bottom is a room with 2 iron golems guarding a book. you can only open the door with the key you get from the madman at the gates of Bandit prison <I>	-- El Shrimpo 12/28/99 </i><br>Shrimpo was right, the place is really cool looking. Me (17th lvl War) and my Monarch (21st lvl Archer) checked it out. 1st off, for you platemail wearing guys like me, the Ice Gromies blast a nasty breath of zub-zero cold. I took like 14-20 points per blast and a 38 pt critical. Be prepared, not like me standing with an Ice Tachi in hand. Big 0 damage. Down past about 6 of thease and a handful of Rats you come to a deadend room with a large opening in the middle. Lokk down, there is a bridge that you can safely jump too, but be ready for another Ice gromie. One way will go to a deadend with am Ice Golem. Not too tough, less deadly than the Gromies I thought. The other way lead around to another deadend, but with a room to jump down into. 1 or 2 Ice Golems here. There is a deadend hall one way, a set of stairs up the other and a door out. Up the stairs will take you to another bridge and you will see the Lich that was been casting all the spells on you while you were down below. Across the bridge is a locked door. This must be the one you need to have the key from, and there were 2 Iron Golems in there, 42nd level. (shiver) We didnt have the key so we went back down to the other door. Open this and there is a T intersection. If you are around our level, and you go right, you will go right to the lifestone, dont pass go, dont collect 200 pyerels. 42 lvl Iron Golem. Hit me with a spell for 55 pts dmg, and smashed my monarch for over 100, for an instant death. But, if you just haul ass to the left, you will see the exit portal. Good luck,   - Vylarn of Harvestgain <I>	-- Vylarn 1/10/00 </i><br>I did this level as a level 25 war/life/item mage - no real problems.  Just take it slow. At the end, you will be under a rope/wood bridge.  At the top, a Lich was powerless while I drained him.  He didnt spawn for > 10 minutes.  I went to where he stood, in front of the door, and drained the 2 iron golems.  Used the key to go inside and get my loot.  No real problem here.  Cave looked really cool.  Just watch out for ice golems and ivory gromnies. <I>	-- Vincent Price 3/31/2000 </i><br>If you cant Drain or Harm your enemies try this out. When you get to the end of the dungeon, where the 2 irons guard the book, run up to the door after kiling the lich, then slide over to the left of it, 99% of the time one of the irons will come to the door while the other gets stuck on the wall, now you can chop his grimy arse to bits while he throws spell after spell into the dorr (not one came thru after more than 10 kills (for test purposes). Then if u have the key, go on in and take down the other at your leisure. One more thing, the Ivory Groms spit fire NOT ice, and there is one bridge that you shouldnt dilly on as it has a CHILL AIR patch on it and will give you the sniffles. <I>	-- Usagi Rai 5/6/2000 </i>Stop #16 in the Undead Mechanic quest added in the October 2003 patch. Yes, you still need to make the specialized carrot soup to give to the guy at the Bandit castle. <I>-- Geomancer 11/16/2003</i>Cave was upgraded with wasteland rats and ebon gromnies. Fast respawn rate in upper level. See ACMaps for dungeon details. Good experience for the midlevel player who can take on the rats and gromnies with minimal damage. No level restriction, cannot summon, but can recall.<br><br>Salvage quality runs from 3 - 7 on average. Can make decent money from looting bodies. Made +100k per visit.

Bring your fire arrows. <I>	-- Brenna 1/3/00 </i><br>Entrance is guarded by a pack of fast-genning skeletons and skeleton warriors, foyer is safe, spawn rate is slow.

This is what the map dot indicates. <I> -- Curunir</i><br>Good dungeon layout. Scalvus are cool looking creatures, but weak for this lvl 34 unarmed - they should be buffed up a lot. A lot of switch pulling in this one. A portal to GW I think is immediately inside. A group of 15-25 level folks should be able to handle this place. Take S.Dires portal near Mayoi to S. Dires, and you are real close - I think. <I>	-- Elder 1/6/00 </i><br>Portal to Riverbend 2.3S, 63.3E <I>	-- Darksilver 1/8/00 </i><br>Went in with lvl 25 Warrior, and 28 Archer. Very cool dungeon, fun, but dangerous. Be aware .... after you pull the levers that will open a door, on the upper platform, there will be a series of floor traps that will open and close doors. If you let this main door close b4 you finish this section of the dungeon, you will be trapped. We looked for 3 hours, in about a 6 room area for a lever, button or something to let us out. Wound up commiting suicide and re-entering the dungeon. Maybe we missed something, but would be smart to have 1 member stand outside the door, to run back and reopen it if it closes. We didnt go any farther, as we ran out of time, but i think there is much more to the place. Take 3 people just incase. 1 last thing, when you incounter the little ZEFIRs go for the little Red Bastard 1st. He will hit you rapidly with lvl 3 and 4 spells. A warrior can hack them appart in 2-3 swings, but do it quickly. Good luck. <I>	-- Vylarn -Harvest 3/6/2000 </i><br>This is a medium-size pull levers dungeon, with many traps on the upper level.  The outside is infested, the foyer is clear.  But, the portal to the surface is at the bottom, not near the entrance.  Upper level is a mix of scalvi and zefirs, bottom pure scalvi.

A very convenient Tower located on the hill above the Tumerok Chamber in the South Dires, not far from where the Mayoi portal drops you off.  To get there, one must go all the way around the base of the mountain till you find a way up, then run all the way back.  Why convenient?  Because there is a Lifestone and Portal to Qalabar at the same spot.

The lower beach is easily accessible from the valley and has the Tumerok Chamber, Lightless Catabombs and peddler on it.  The upper beach has this tower-portal-lifestone complex.  One way to the upper beach is Escalator Slope around the far side of the mountain: 86.6 S, 37.8W for lower beach and 86.4S, 37.6 for upper beach.

The coordinate is approximate, but within 1-2 degrees.  The reason it is not exact will be apparent once you read this. This place is one of the nastiest in all of Dereth.  It is black, save for a forest of tall mushrooms (3x human height), and blue gemstones...  Densely spawned throughout the area are virindi - puppets, servants, and masters...  along with tusker guards and obsidian golems.  In the very center of this crater is a large pink fountain that is surrounded by tusker guards (no less than 20, perhaps as many as 30).  I ran by very quickly so i didnt see the nature of the fountain.  I will explore it again and add more later, or hope that someone else has discovered its secret and will add to my tale. <I> -- Ryukyu</i><br>This place is about 5 - 10 mins away from the HOLL.

If you want a massive challenge go for it. <I>	-- Toekiller 1/13/00 </i><br>Seeing your post I went there out of sheer curiosity. No joking about 100 virindi, 10-20 wisps, 5-10 Obsidian Golems, and 20-30 tuskers all concentrated in a about a 1 kilometer radius. I scanned through for inanimate objects, found nothing. I ran through the fountain and also nothing. However I never hit fountain dead on virindi were controlling my movements more than my keyboard I was bouncing off em. <I>	-- fyre 1/18/00 </i><br>The fountain restores health, much like a mana pool in the meeting halls.   <I>	-- The Mad Jester  12/15/2000 </i><br>I finally got here and felt a little dissappointment.

A cute little white bunny rabbit in a bunker, Pookie, per the AC Devs.  It is Level 666 and breathes lightning.. run away .. run away. DO NOT ID IT, or it will attack you.  Area is populated with high level monsters. At certain times of the year, there may be two level 230 white rabbit babies spawning here too.   The white rabbit does piercing and lightning melee damage and has a 1 hit magic life drain move called Bunny Smite that is almost always fatal.  It is very fast, and quite deadly.  Debuffing it will cause it to counter buff.  Overwhelming it with rending weapons can work well, although that takes a larger group.  There are various ideas about the right strategy to use with this creature.  When it is defeated, it Smites the one who did the most damage, usually fatal.  It drops an Orb of the Bunny Booty, no drop, no give.  It also has a givable carcass.  You can use 2 of these to create white rabbit slippers.  Hand one in to William Witty in Lytelthorpe, and then combine what he gives you with your other white rabbit carcass.  Respawn time is about 15 minutes.<I>  -- Rick O Shay -- Arkayas -- Polecat -- Nightwolf -- Some Guy -- Garfield Bond -- Luci X -- Tak -- BURNED -- Life and Death -- Taarna Blood SC </i> <br> Ahhh and more info, it will kill you in maximum 2 hits, it uses a hollow lightning attack for melee and Bunny Smite spell (drains 1-4000 health, I saw one person only get 200 health drained). The way to kill it:  Make a wall of melees to just surround the entrance, make archers behind them to shoot it, and behind that mages with 400 buffed creature/life skills. Have them Yield it, then vuln 7 then imp 7 IT WILL SMITE THEM. Have at least 3 mages because the bunny may smite 2. The bunny will try to get to the mages who vulned/impd him so make sure you kill it quick before it kills the person who vulned it. After that it will kill melees and youll have a corpse for it to eat. So, yield, vuln, imp while the melees block it from getting to the mages/archers. Then archers unload on it fire damage. Boom hes dead, not too hard just have some high level melees/archers/mages  and use this method. Ahh yes, and dont ID the sucker or he will attack you, up till then hes peaceful, and the rock isnt safe, he will smite you AND jump on it .  <I> -- Stay puff of MT 7/13/2001 </i>

Gate is locked, get a key from one of the Tumeroks in the tower next to the Slaughter House portal, or pick it... takes good, but not superb, pickskill (base 100 plus buffs and lock weakens).  Good hunting if you can handle the spawn pace.  Fort Tethana is a reasonable run due east.<I> -- Doc Feelgood</I><br>Due to some strange spawning bug in the March update this area is now BLANKETED with gold wasps. There is a wasp right next to where the portal drop you so be prepare to fight or flight as soon as your feet hit the ground.

Looks to be part of the March Quest, since I had never seen it before, and the huge room which you must jump into is snowwing so I presume it is the snow portion of the quest. <I> -- Kamaitachi</i><br>Dont jump down. Jump across to the ledge.  If you look hard, you will see it over on your right when facing the first pit. <I>	-- Heysun 2/24/2000 </i><br>Not just lich lords.

Heres a shortcut but you need at least a 270 jump skill. Enter the dungeon and clear the 1st room. Right in front of you when you enter is a passage with a torch above it and a large rock just in front of it to the right. Jump on top of the rock, use shift+jump to jump on top of the torch, turn 180 degrees and jump up to the ledge, follow the ledge back towards the torch, you will come to a pit. Jump diagonal to your left to the large ledge, there is a door there that leads to the end and the Major Stone.

David ibn Jensen <I> -- David ibn Jense 1/20/2002 </i><br>Entrance and Exit are quiet. Portals can be tied to and Recalled, but not summoned. The foyer is hot, covered by three Lich Lords and a Revenant.  The only exit portal is at the far end of the dungeon near the Stinging Stone Room. Following a right hand rule will take you through some heavy fighting to a jump into a large, long room. At the far end of the room is the hall leads to the second floor, and ultimately to the Major Stining Stone.  Following left hand rule will take you to a quieter section of the dungeon on the first level, and some dead end routes to the second floor.

I went there by myself but since im an acher with 210 melee D they kicked my ass bad, so i suggest u go wwith a group of between 2-5 to get thru the olthoi onto the perch spot. <I>	-- Darks Lord 1/16/2001 </i><br>One note about the archer perch...heavily camped, and bickering goes on there quite a bit. I would have to say in order of population, this is tougher than OHN by far, especially when you go into the large rooms, Olthoi come out from 8 directions. Great fun though...if you live. <I>	-- Punisher Zod 1/24/2001 </i><br>The perches were removed, as per the August 2001 patch.  Tread carefully. <I> -- Nocturne [LC] 9/3/2001 </i><br>Good.

You also need to control the levers on the ground floor, and then will be able to get further in the complex.  Down some stairs, a brief respite as the tuskers and virindi are behind a closed door.  Open the door, using a lever, and you are in another area with a couple of tuskers, and virindi.  Another pointless empty chest, and an upstairs path that leads to switches to open an exit portal, and a door that leads to the final area.  I would not recommend jumping down, as there is little hiding place from a dozen virindi puppets and fairy things, but an exit is placed there, back to the surface. <I>	-- Goldhart 5/2/2000 </i><br>Well what can I say about this place...A great drain spot for lifers...But heed my warning If you see Krow or Ryucho zen in the harvest gain world and myself...get out I will never stop trying to kill them and I dont care who gets in my way... <I>	-- Krack of HG 9/18/2000 </i><br>Goldhart, I would like to note, that your post above is a complete waste of text, and should be deleted. <I> -- Fairy GodMother 7/3/2001 </i>

They spawn on the spire but will jump down onto you if you get close (read massive impact damage).  Lot of traffic through this area headed to the Virindi Fort, so usually all the liches end up huddled around the base of the spire waiting to bum rush you if you attack or get close.  The spire itself basically has a wraparound path leading up to the top where there are two chests with ... drumroll please ... nothing in them.  Usually Ob golems and high level drudges around spire as well.  Unless you like lich xp and loot, skip this place and head over to the Virindi fort. <I> -- Arioc</i>

I have only taken the one to the right, and at the bottom of that once you go down the hallway, and if your solo youll die, there is a room with an uber chest 2 virindi masters, and i think 3 or 4 guards. Safest thing is to back into a corner when in trouble if your a mage, and just start imperiling the tuskers. Once imperiled the archers and meleers jump on em.  Great xp for a lvl 40ish archer fellowed with the same lvl life mage. <I>	-- Theneler ( TD ) 6/22/2000 </i><br>Lamest, the most idiotic dungeon of Dereth. Really efficient ruining of gaining levels with effort. Little over 30s mages running around at peak hours draining Slaves to 1/4 and then portal recall and same again. Most people dont even bother to finish off the tuskers at all - just waiting to someone else to get their attention. This dungeon is making more selfish and idiotic powerlevelers to Dereth.  <I>	-- Finkish 6/29/2000 </i><br>Rooms are big, hallways are wide, the tuskers move about easily, and wall working is hard.  Life mages have compensated by innovating a gang work technique instead, and have prospered.  (It is nice that this game can be played in many ways.) <I>	-- Doc Feelgood 7/1/2000 </i><br>The left down ramp leads to a Servant and then several large areas with lots of guards.  Following this a ways youll get to a big hall with alcoves on the sides of it, with tuskers in.  At the end of this hall is another ramp down with about 12 Drudge Ravs and Stalkers, and a couple of Virindi.  Theres a chest in the room with the drudges (uber I guess).  Two locked doors after this, followed by a long hallway up and an exit portal.  Why would a mage drain a slave to 1/4 and then portal out?  Who kills the tuskers then?  I never see anyone draining for 2/3 or 3/4 and running -- people kill what theyre fighting... oh well.  Sorry your experience isnt better Finkish... =( <I>	-- Chen Kenichi 9/8/2000 </i><br>BSD Ayan Baqur on DarkTide was nerfed, down to 8 tusker spawn near the uberchest, still alright hunting on a 7 minute spawn... <I>	-- -PsychoStarfire 10/13/2000 </i><br>The XP is good...if you can get it.  Three words best describes this place...TOO MANY MAGES. I spent too much time trying to find my own kills.  In the end I gave up and began kill stealing, its the only way to get the good XP everyone talks about.  My level 52 guy can easily take these tuskers on, but its a real fight trying to keep your kills.  Its no better than Qualabar Citadel and the lag is even worse (at least at the Teth BSD it is).  Mages are only after the tuskers and will flee when confronted by high level drudges and virindi. Back to OHN or Lugian Excavation for me.  Loot is much better, XP is almost the same and Mages there are very rare.  <I>	-- prok 2/19/2001 </i><br>I dont know what everyone is smoking but I am lvl 38 mage and with my draining and my lvl 6 buffs, Tuskers are about as hard to kill as an ant. Trust me any mage which casts 6s will kick tusker ass, only problem with BSD is such a slow spawn rate, and it almost forces us to steal kills :( <I> -- Ghandalf 7/25/2001 </i>

They will be trapped within this mess.  Farther down you come to a room which everyone calls the ""flood room"".  Not sure how many have been here.  Narrow hallway going into this room, soldiers swarm in.  I did not have time to approximate the number of soldiers here because there was just to many to count.  I would say at least 50 hit this room at once if not more. 3-6 uber chests found so far.

At the bottom of the dungeon usually has a surface portal, but not this one.  No the Zak OHN has a portal at the bottom that takes you to the Bandit Castle OHN (surface of course).  This is great for when Zak OHN becomes too camped, but then again so is Bandit OHN. There are 2 Uberchests in the dungeon, I would fully ignore the 2nd chest on the 3rd floor (in the flood room where about 20-30 Olthoi Soldiers spawn in a large room with a narrow entrance hallway).

You want a challenge, you wanna see some of the coolest battles in all of dereth? Youve come to the right place. Murk Warrens has only 2 BREEDS of monsters. Mosswarts (Feeders-Cheifs) in the first half, and Banderlings (Scouts-Ravers) in the second half. In 1st area if the dungeon, the monsters only rush in at the front (about 5-15 at a time). As you progress in the dungeon, they come in about 20 at a time, in front, and 10 rush in from the back. Oh, and remember that the respawn time is 2 mins, so alot of times, as you kill 1 wave, another wave will spawn behind you. I didnt know my way around too well, because it is dark, and so is my monitor (it REALLY REALLY sucks), but when you get to a locked door in the mosswart area, DO NOT GO IN FOR GODS SAKE. There are about 10 moss cheifs and 50+ other mosswarts that will rush out as you open it. Besides that, when you are fighting that group, youll get side rushed by a group down another hallway. There is also a room in the banderling area with the same situation, but diffrent look. Just look for the locked doors. This place IS NOT reccomended for mages =P. I know because I am one (lvl 22 all schools mage), and I went with a group of Melee fighters. If your a mage, stay in back and cast de-buffs on the stronger guys and heal, & infuse stamina on your allys. If you waste mana using war spells, your done for because theyll start to rush YOU. If your in a group, make sure all the melee fighters are lvl 20-35.

After you give her the tumerok insignia, she tells you that her sister is on the edge of Dryreach and you have 30 minutes to find her.  Go to the house at 9.0S 73.7E, and she is locked in the cellar.  Her sister, Dansha-Ki, will tell you that she needs her spell components to escape.  Tumeroks took her belongings north, just moments ago.  After you talk to her, a tumerok guard will spawn.  Kill it and it drops bone key, which you must have.  Her belongings are in the Tumerok Tower at 6.3S 73.6E.  Use the bone key to get in and her pack is at the top.  Take her pack to the Tumerok House and give it to her.  She will give you a Gem of Portal Recall and Dansha-Kis Ring, which is Magic Resis III & Lightning Resis III (diff: 110).  You can only perform this quest once in a set time frame. Not sure how long. Not sure why youd wanna do it more than never.  Lots of Tumerok Warriors, Fighters, and Scouts. <I>	-- Harkoth  11/20/2000 </i><br>The Dryreach or Portal Gem Quest is broken.

Entry is courtesy of   -- <I>Polecat</i><br>5 or 6 Tumerok warriors, an officer, and 1 or 2 grunts occupy a one-sided defensive barricade.  Most are on the ground behind the wall, a couple are on the ramparts.  This is a dangerous spot to attack alone as the Tumeroks will not allow you to tease them into single combat, and the firepower coming out of this position, especially the back side, can have a mid level warrior running for cover.  Level III magic bolts, and arrows fired by level 20 Tumerok Warriors.  The loot is heavy, mostly magic weapons and armor, but Dryreach is visible from the wall.   <I>	-- Jann 9/30/2000 </i><br>WOAH.  Did I forget to mention that the Officer throws level V bolts??  One shot took almost 100 points off.  Also, if you kill a Tunerok within range the others seem to get a fix on you and you will suffer a rain of arrows and magic bolts.  <I>	-- Jann 9/30/2000 </i>
!2134,Tumerok House,Interest,6.8S,72.7E,0S,0E,7/6/2000,<level></level><exit></exit> Destination: . Entry is courtesy of   -- <I>Polecat</i><br>A little military style combat.  Dryreach is under siege, and the Tumeroks have set up this roadblock to restrict travel into the city.  You cant really see the house from the road.  You will know you are getting close when you see the tower off to the left.  If you are travelling on the road you will not see the sentrys until you are caught in a crossfire of quarrels fired from behind the protection of roadside bushes.  Best to start from the outside and work your way in.  About 4 fighters and 5 scouts guard the road, and sometimes the back side of the house.  2 Warriors are either in or near the house, and they will occasionally fire level III bolts at you.  But this is a defensive position, and the Tumeroks fight like humans.  They wont chase you far.  You have to go in and get them.  They like to stand behind cover, bushes, trees, rocks, so archers make sure you have a clear shot.  A mid level warrior can handle the grunts pretty easily, but watch the warriors and bring your magic resist or your heal kits, because those bolts sting.  When you attack the house itself you may trigger a massive spawn of reinforcements, but they dont seem to want to cross the road, and I have never been able to engage them in battle.  Where do they go?? The loot is heavy, and mostly magic.  But take it.  You will rake up in town, as the prices are quite high.   <I>	-- Jann 9/30/2000 </i><br>There are actually two spawning points here, one directly in front of the house and the other is a little ways north.  Depending on how long it has been since someone came through and cleaned it out there could be as many as 20 Tumeroks between the two spawns, 4 or 5 of them being warriors.  The warriors WILL chase you, especially if they have you injured.   <I>	-- StoneCold 9/30/2000 </i>

Groups of 3 amploth and laigus up top are no problem, the toughest part will be once you get down to the mining floor/caves about 8 can come at you from both sides if youre not careful. Oh, and if youre looking for the ore, go straight ahead (going around the rings as neccesary) until you get down to the bottom floor. Then go right, and youll find a portal to the surface and the ore. When in doubt, go right. As above, not too tough for a melee in the high teens or low twenties.

Beware the Level 7 Dispell Trap between the first two doors.  Full of Relic Bones, Diamond Golems, Umbris Shadows, Firestorms, Cursed Wisps and Rats.  With the quest update during From the Darkness Born  this dungeon now has 2 level breaks.  In order to get the Recall Scroll, you MUST give the Sacrifical Dagger from Aerlinthe Reservor to The Ghost of Galaeral who is inside this dungeon.  He is located near the start on the right side near the exit portal and is behind a lever door.  The Dagger weakens Lady Aerfalle and activates the 45+ quest.  If you do not hand in the dagger, Lady Aerfalle will be the 80+ version.  In the high level version she is very dangerous and should not be taken lightly.  She dispells and casts Self protect spells if debuffed.  Lady Aerfalle has around 5000 hp and looks like a living Empyrean woman, a very mean Empyrean woman.  Use rending weapons and War to defeat her.  She will lock onto a single person, debuff them, and then beat them mercilessly.  Bring Healer Hearts, dispell gems, and a well organized group.  She also has some VOD type undead bodyguards.  Regardless, she drops around 9 keys in both 45+ and 80+ versions.  The spawn does not stop and maintains its relatively fast rate.  Run up to the chest room, minding the 2nd Level 7 Dispell Trap at its entry.  Use your key on the appropriate chest.  The 80+ Version does NOT get the recall scroll, however the items are much better than the 45+ version.  The 80+ Ashbane can be given to its old owner for 10 million XP while the 45+ Ashbane gives 500k.   <I> --Taarna Blood SC 10/13/2004 </i>

Shown by my patron, Nevir of Frostfell, this perch allows you to shoot or target at monsters overhead.  Because of the steepness of the slope in front or on the side of you, the monsters can not climb to attack you.  It is my recommendation that you come from the direction of 77.8S, 25.5S so you can climb on to the perch.  Basically, its a ledge of a mountain.  Very neat spot.   It oversees a valley filled with Lugians, Matties, and other monsters. - Julian the Bashir of Frostfell 9/5/2000<br>I decided to give this place a try.

We made short work of them.  Alot of fun for the fact of nothing else to do.  Btw, only about 2k exp per kill. Its not worth the effort for experience.

I have seen two rumors regarding Fycheck (one was handed to me by someone in Holtburg...didnt get his name... and the other I found on the ground near the West Shoushi Lifestone). Both rumors were entitled The Fycheck Outpost. Here are the two rumors, as written on the parchments. Fycheck was a Noble Sho warrior, known for his skill with the blade and for his being prone to wanderlust as no other Sho ever has. Indeed a great warrior, it is rumored he met his demise on a mountain plateau west of Shoushi. Hidetaki, his faithful Sifu heard of his students death and summoned warriors throughout the land to extract revenge on the creatures that caused the demise of his friend and student. Hidetakis forces were never seen alive again. As Hidetaki and his band of loyal warriors were extracting revenge on the creatures that killed the noble Fyckeck, four of the warriors panicked and fled the battlefield. After discovering a safe haven in an abandoned tower far to the south, the dishonored warriors were grief stricken that they had dishonored themselves by fleeing. Before they could commit Sepuku, to regain their honor, they were killed by a nearby wisp. Since they died with dishonor, they now haunt that tower as undead, hating the living with great passion. <I> -- Grundak</i>

Ladies and Gentlemen, without further ado I present you the savant <I>Tyr on HG<br> --  Immacolata 7/20/2003 </i></b><br> Yes this is a random dungeon, yes there are allready a billion and one entries for it <i>(edit: no more, cleaned out a kajillion of those, thanks to Doc Feelgood</i>), yes I am apolagising for entering another one, but I tried several times to add to the Floating City (Primary) thread and managed only to put in one line... so here is what I was trying to say, assuming this adds itself. There is far too much speculation and rumour on this thread, so, since I know virtually everything there is to know about the city, let me set a few things straight. Firstly, portals may now be tied and recalled to, they cant be summoned but if you see one on the landscape, tie to it, and camp it for any friends who may want to tie too (random portals only disapear when the landblock resets, so if your watching the portal it wont go anywhere). Secondly, there is no pattern to the portals appearing, they are RANDOM. Thirdly, multiple portals can spawn on the surface, the city is broken up into 8 different landblocks (7 called The Floating City, and one The Golem Sanctum), and I think all of them can be created as random landscape portals. I think the golem sanctum only spawns in the dires but I cant confirm that). Thus all these reports saying when you enter go this way are useless because it all depends on which part of the city you have entered. Now, when you enter the city, your first step is to do a /loc and work out which landblock your in, then before jumping off anything or going through any portals, check ACMaps.com which has maps of the city (done by yours truely). So far Ive only done 6, Im waiting on the random portals to take me back to the final two landblocks. That raises another point, many of the portals between the different parts of the city are random as well, which is why you should tie to the first one you found, as you may not be able to get back to explore more. Inside the city, all exit portals, and lots of the internal portals (all helpfully called just The Floating City) are random, but unlike random portals on the surface, they are allways in the same place, but every month (on patch day) they change their destination. On the maps I have made all portals are identified as either stable or random, stable portals all have a return portal next to them to facilitate two way travel. Lockpicking is not required, but does make a little more of the city accessible, it is I believe posible to get everywhere by random portals but random portals are of course random. The toughest door is resistance 322, and worth picking if you can because it leads on to a stable portal to another section. There are what apears to be two significant points of interest in the city, one is the golem sanctum, an absolute labyrinth of tightly twisting passages and more junctions than I can count, all filled with Iron golems, and at the end one obsidian with a dispell trap and a chest of crap loot. The other point of interest is something everyone should see at least once in their life, a floating advocate tower in the direlands (3.7S / 69.2W), about as high above the ground as the tou-tou lighthouse is tall, and with a bright pink energy fountain inside it. On top is a random portal to the direlands somewhere. At the begining of the Golem Sanctum is a stable portal back to the city, and a random direlands portal, I have seen these portals go to North Direlands Valley Junction, and my old favorite hunting ground North Direlands Land Bridge. During this months patch I also found a portal whos name and location I didnt write down, but the drop was so hot I died before I materialised. Shortly after that they did a server rollback and the portal changed again. Within the city you will find a number of Strained Books, which cannot be picked up but give you some interesting lore about the place, and some interesting insights into the Empyrians past. In all I would say this whole place is priety much a place only to come if you like exploring and lore, the monsters inside are for the most part, low level undead and a few banderlings, there are 2 virindi servants, and 2 revanants, and thats about it for the high level monsters. However, it does make a wonderful alternative to the Abandoned Mines as a subway, because while the portals change every month, there are a lot of exit portals and they drop you in often rare towns like Kara. A few non town portals spawn, but rarely, and all Ive noticed is Heartland which has to be one of the most common random portals (and the most boring). Anyways, Im begining to ramble on without really saying much, so I will just say that the floating city is a great place to visit, and a nice place to tie to and use as a subway (incidentally the exit portals can be tied to and summoned, so when you find a Kara portal, take a copy of it for your guild, its a nice quiet town that sells level 6 scrolls for those rich enough to afford them). Should anyone be interested in learning more, go take a look at ACMaps.coms maps and post a message on this thread, I look at it occasionally, alternatively if your on harvestgain, just tie to the city and use it to get arround, Im sure well bump into each other there (tho its never happened yet, portals in are VERY rare). <I> -- Tyr on HG  12/3/2002</i>

You go from Mosswart Shamans on the island to suddenly being greeted by Island Dillos (lvl 38) Jungle Phyntos wasps (lvl 65) Shallows Destroyers (lvl 37?) and Shallows Devourer (lvl 50-some). I would recommend a group of at least 6 to 8 decked out level 25-30 people to even attempt this dungeon. Be ready for some serious tanking. The dillos and destroyers are immensely painful. I went in here with 3 lvl 26+ Melees and we got wasted hard, I ended up with 15% vitae Personally, I feel this level restrict needs to be fixed.

At the end of the high level area spawns the Singularity Fragment which when combined with the Heart of Shadows and the Skull opens a portal to BaelZharons lair.

One portal levels 15-30 enters a place that then has 2 portal levels 15-25 and 15-30? inside.  results are the Skull of Palacost, a new Obsidian Dagger (4-8?) and the Barbed fletching tool? Was unable to enter myself, just sat and buffed my vassals and others. undead, liches,etc inside. <I> -- Senshin -MT</I><br>Portals are *not* tieable here -- closest tieable are in the Yaraq area.  Foyer is clear, top is clear... barely, mid-level desert monsters are easily brought to top area by heros running in.  Top exit portal is guarded by a lich.  Dungeon is large, winding, and populated with lich and higher level undead (Risen Soldiers and Risen Knights).  The quests are designed to be attempted by large (8-16), well organized parties (know your route, know your levers, plan your body recovery).  <I>	-- Doc Feelgood 12/25/2000 </I><br>All liches, lich lords, and Risen soldiers(26)and knights. risen do not cast but have excellent melee. bring your ~190+ jump and as much run as you can.  There are acid pits here I have yet to see a mage cross ;(   <I>	-- senshin 12/27/2000 </I><br>Inner portals are: lower (15-25) and upper (21-30). Upper side acid pit can be jumped with 148 jump/150 run (a mage doing it ;->). For a quick jump check, see if you can jump on top of the tall rock at the entrance. If you can, you can probably jump the acid pit.  Upper and lower parties must coordinate their lever pulling to get through.  Lower group gets the dagger and archery tool, upper group gets the skull.  There are surface portals at the jump down point and just beyond the party split point. <I>	-- Doc Feelgood 12/28/2000 </I><br>update: there are *three* acid pits to jump, the second requires 199 jump, third is easy.  Upper level guardian is Mausoleum Director (55th).  Whatever size group you think you need, double it. <grin> (20 would be comfortable). <I>	-- Doc Feelgood 12/31/2000 </I><br>Well, as for the acid pits on the high side which is lvls 21-30, i cleared all 3; the first 2 with a jump of 200, and the last with 220. (this was a standing jump mind you). Also you can do this quest with only 8 people, we had 4 for the high side and 4 for the low. wasn't too bad, just watch for the respawn at the end, if you're not ready for war magic, you're dead. <I> -- Elhanan Jabar 1/5/2002 </I>

The Lyceum as it is commonly called, was founded by Exarch Hieromancer Sephrena Mirenndae, who later became Priestess of the Adjanite Sisterhood of Ithaenc.  This will be your destination if you are on the Mage Armor quest.  I would suggest Level 60+ for this place.<br>The Lyceum is on the top of a sheer cliff and can only be reached by using a Lyceum Recall Gem (which you must construct).  It is no recall, so dont die. One of the gem components is on a week long timer.  After you construct and use a Lyceum Recall Gem, you will be transported to a safe area within the Lyceum.  The friendly NPC golem Eaushi the Trainer is there to greet you.  Do as he asks and you will receive crystals.  Give them to him for the uncharged mage armor.  You can also give him a Blue Orb from the Heiromancer Halls and you will be rewarded with the Globe of Aubrean orb.  Or you can give him a Sunstone Geode, a very rare random drop on the Nephol Golems within the Lyceum, for a Heiromancer orb.<br>The entire complex is very interesting and worthy of a look.  There is a cooking dress in one of the locked chests in a building.  The guard golems hold a key to this.  There is also a Lightweight Tome hidden in the library at the mountain peak.  Although this tome is suprisingly heavy, it can be written in.  You can get outside by using a lever or jumping over the wall.  If you have a low jump you may need a friend to stay at the lever in order for you to get back in.  If not, you may be able to jump from the hillside and clear the wall.  Whatever you do, dont fall off.  You may lose your corpse forever. <I> -- Taarna Blood SC </i><br><br><br></i>

!3180,Soul Fearing Vestry,Dungeon,88.3S,10.7W,0S,0E,3/20/2001,<level></level><exit></exit> Destination: . This is a great mid-level quest. The tower to the West is tower 1, the southern one is tower 3, and the one kind of in the middle (and highest one) is the 2nd. Kill the lich in the first, run up inside the thing and hit the lever. Then run inside the second and kill the undead (run inside to get them to spawn) it will open 3rd tower door. Run inside there and kill the undead that spawn outside. Kill the lesser LAST or the quest may break (and youll PISS OFF alot of people). If you learn the spawn points you can jump over the traps and not fight monsters, but other than the liches I found the place easy. On the high acolyte Ive never had a problem and Im lvl 33. You can leave your guy in that last chamber where he spawns and come back every 5 hours if you want to get a bunch of Yucky Keys (4 pulls per key). I recommend doing the chests when theres a few people around, 1 is uber weapons/armor/jewelry/clothes/wands/gems/etc., one is uber weapons/armor and the other is crap. Usually if you go there at hours when a decent amount of people inside there will be a few to tell you which chests are which. All in all its a pretty easy quest if you know what your doing, but if you run ahead and start hitting traps and spawn too many critters (especially in the last section) youll get yourself and others killed. @tell me if you need help.  <I> -- Ken the Feeble</i> Either play the tower lever-pull game, or more simply, wait for the Lesser Acolyte to spawn (every 15 min.)in front of the towers, and kill him for a portal to appear for access to the dungeon. Dungeon is split into three sections, first section is Zombies, second is Skeleton Captains and the last by Liches. Creatures appear on spawn traps. You trigger the trap, and the creature spawns. Most traps are in the corners of rooms and hallways, but not always. At the end of each section is a Lesser Acolyte that you must kill to make a portal appear to access the next section. Lesser Acolytes improve in level the further you go, until the last one which is level 48. Sadly, I did not loot each acolyte as I went, apparently they have the keys for the 4 chests in the room that have lockpick resistance of 9999. SIKs do not work on said chests. There is also a lousy chest on the west wall that gives crud. Great looking dungeon, lots of neat light effects. Entered by Grundas the Dark <I> 8/8/2000 </i><br>An arrangement of 3 towers, each with buttons and/or levers on the inside. The button/lever in one tower opens the door to another tower. Ooodles of little trigger steps<br> entire dungeon quest would be fun for a few mid-levellers, alas, the run to get to this spot is not mid-level at all. <I> -- Garfield3d</i><br>VERRY important note, when nabbing the 4-use yucky key from te high acolyte at the end and hoping the portal to the chest room, you be be MUCH hapier if do NOT use the key on the 2 chests that are on the same wall together. Those 2 chests have TERRIBLE loot compared to the other two, which par with Uber Chests. Be sure to juts wait out the 15 minute spawn on the chest on the bench and the one to its left, youll thank me later. <I>	-- Sargonas 8/13/2000 </i><br>THE safest way to get there : go to Qalabar, take the road that goes south, follow it till it ends, then stay on the serpentine forested hill, it goes to the bottom in a gentle slope. Once there, just follow the valley to the Towers. Youll find some Tumeroks, Mattekars and low level Drudges and Skeletons. Its a little longer, but that way its a mid-level quest. I made the trip with my 10th level mage, without any problems <br>-) <I>	-- Jestra of MT 8/18/2000 </i><br>The chests are on a 5 minute spawn, not 15.  Also, to confirm the 2 chests on the East wall have really bad loot.. they DO.  The North chest is mainly wands/gems/clothing, while the West chest is mainly armor/weapons.  The North chest HAS given some GREAT helms though.  All in all a great quest.  Fun for 1st timers too, who have no idea whats going on. :) <I>	-- Dorn Axehaft MT 9/5/2000 </i><br>Ok heres the real correct info on acolyte towers....first of all I need to say its a 7 minute spawn on chests as well as high acolyte.This quest can be done every 5 hours...when you get to the final room there will 2 pairs of 2 liches that spawn as you head towards acolyte the spawn is activated by floor traps...after the liches do NOT enter room solo...unless you can handle it.You can sucessfully stand at the very end of the hallway with out triggering acolyte or liches and buff up for the battle but watch your back people coming behind you will with any regards to you trigger the spawn(I speak from experience here)There are also individuals who will attempt to kill you at this spot(at least on hg)The west chest spawns armor and weapons of various qualities from UBER to UBER CRAP.The north spawns jewelry wands gems and the occasional armor weapons spawns here are usually AWESOME and in my opinion worth the wasted pulls to get that one good one...The best way to get here to my knowledge is to head west from Qalabar then follow beach (northern edge)when you get to the equitarial axis stop and put lightning protects on if you got them~hehe and run like the wind.There is a LS here and i recommend using it.One other important note:There are some people who enjoy disabling the dungeon and then stay in the area...in order to reset(fix) the acolytes spawn to enter the area must be cleared for 15 minutes for the land block to reset...That mean totally cleared the best way to accomplish this is just to log off for 15 minutes...1st and 2nd lvls are cake 3rd gets tough but if you can handle 2-3 liches at a time solo I recommend coming here best chests in the game... <I>	-- Krack of HG 9/9/2000 </i><br>Definitely follow the coast. I went through one of the valleys headed west and saw shadow lieutenants, berserker and striker banderlings and a few other high level baddies. <I>	-- Mothgog  9/30/2000 </i><br>The south coast route has spawn points which can produce Bone Knights and Bone Lords<br> Ive heard the north coast route is better.	 <I>	-- Red and Gold 10/6/2000 </i><br>Just follow any coast. =) Spawns are random and you could see Armoredillos to Shadows to Bone Lords. Even by taking the North shore, you have to cross back South through dangerous land since the towers lie in close proximity to the Southern shore. Run fast, keep your mini-map open... <I>	-- Garfield3d 10/9/2000 </i><br>The Acolyte towers are actually due south of 87.6S 10.6W. All three towers are visible from these coordinates. <I>	-- Slyzzr 11/25/2000 </i><br>Most of the previous posts are crap...  The real scoop is that the end of this simple quest are chests that are lootable 4 times with the yucky(lucky) key.  For an added bonus you also get a skull worth 12,000 exp to an ivory crafter(great to save these for quick vitae burners).  The problem is choosing the right chests at the end to open.  The chest positions in the room change constantly(previous posts telling what ones are good are worthless posts).  Out of the 4 chests 2 are uber loot.  1 contains primarily weapons/armor and the other contains magic items like wands and jewelry.  The best approach to finding the right chests is to either save your keys until you show up in the chest room with someone that has already located the uber chests or go with another adventurer so at most you both only waste one try with your key.  Note: Unless you are lvl 40+ or you have a nice size party I would suggest staying just outside high acolyte room and draw him out with ranged attacks or spells(evil presence is the killer in the room not the acolyte).  My technique is to cast imperil 4 on the high acolyte to where I can 1 time him with ease when he charges me and leaves his room.  The ONLY drawback to this quest is that you can only do it every 5 hrs.  Another note...  The spawn rate for the high acolyte is only around 4-5 minutes.  BTW another nice technique to conque</i>

She drops the Helm of the Simulacra (Impen IV, Invuln IV, Impreg IV, diff 35, melee 180+). Thanks to Leaver, Kieintie, and Wolf Temptress, who stayed and helped me get mine. <I> -- Suriel, MT</i><br>Entrance can be covered by local desert fauna. Foyer is quiet. The dungeon is small and of medium complexity. First part of dungeon is basic brown walls.  Inner part is simulacrium pink. It is essentially one level. The similacriums come in Crafty (15th), Sneaky (33rd) and the South Leader (70th).  The south leader did not seem nearly as tough as North leader, but perhaps both are more vulnerable to archers than meleers. <I> -- Doc Feelgood 9/22/2001 </i><br>While this dungeon is significantly easier than its cousin near Zaikhal, dont underestimate it. Soloing is virtually impossible. The spells cast by the helm compliment those by the shield well, making the set the equipment of choice for mid-level melee fighters.

I have been sent here by the Arcanum to provide Writs of Refuge in return for various items needed to prepare for any coming turmoil that threatens the Isparian presence here on Ispar.  Nuhmudira has informed us that creatures of old may soon be stalking the earth.  And these creatures hold items of value.  Items that we can use.  If you come across a Crest of the Falatacot, a Ring of Mummified Skin, or a Quiddity Crystal, I am able to exchange a Writ of Refuge for any one of these items.  What we need may change at any time, so be prepared. Agent of the Arcanum tells you, Apparently the creatures who hold these items may not be abroad in the land quite yet.  When they first appear, we shall herald their presence and repeat our warning for as long as they stalk the earth. Agent of the Arcanum tells you, Once you possess the Writ of Refuge, then you have satisfied the main requirements for acquiring a home.  The Covenant Crystals also require money and other minor items, but those items should not be in short supply.  Enjoy your homestead.  One note: Nuhmudira has set aside a small number of palatial estates for those allegiances thought to be most worthy of their ownership, and the most generous with their resources.  She has not opened them up yet, but she will soon. Well, exciting <I> -- Immacolata</i>

In order to access the dungeon, you must bring to Ecorto the Lost Director a Fragment of the New Singularity, which is made up from a Sliver of Singular Pyreal, Obsidian, and Chorizite, gained from 3 separate dungeons. Once inside, you will face a Virindi Masters and Directors as well as Tusker Guards in the beginning areas.  The further down you go, there are more and more Virindi Directors and Executors, Tusker Rampagers, and Terebrous Hollow Minions.  In the last room, you will find Levistras, the Speaker of the New Directive (level 85 Virindi), as well as an absolutely INSANE number of Rampagers, Executors, and Terebrous Hollows.  Make sure you bring a huge group or you wont last very long in here.  Bring HIGH AL ARMOUR or youll be fricaseed by the Hollow Minions. New Singularity Director (Levistras) spawns every 5 minutes or so and drops a Virindi Shroud, a cloak with Impen V, Invuln V, Magic Resist V, and Willpower V.

!3607,Singular Obsidian Repository,Dungeon,55.9S,64.8W,0S,0E,10/11/2001,<level>45-56</level><exit></exit> Destination: . The third of the Ecortos (and turbines brilliantly thought out completed-in-half-a-second-quest-to-end-a-nine-month-story-arch-quest) dungeons where you must get a sliver off one of the four Singular Obsidian Pillars in the end of the end of the dungeon. First there be Tusker Guards and virindi puppets. Then servants and masters. At the bottom you meet Rampagers, Tumideon Minions and the Director, plus a gang of Masters guarding the Pillar room. The Director drops a Directors Mask. The respawn rate is maddeningly fast, about 2 seconds, and I have spotted many corpses down here already. Mages stick to the rampagers, and meleers make sure to take out them rickety but hard hitting tumideons fast. The antechamber to the pillar room is narrow and will be place for heavy battles. It is possible for a person to break out of the fight, run across the room down ramp and into the pillar room unscathed. In here you can either dash further down and hide at the exit portals, or run up-ramp to the pillars (ramps are at the left and right at the end of the room). You can perch this place in relative safety. The entry portal cant be tied to, but the surface portal can be. <I> -- Immacolata</i><br>This is a good place to level up on Tusker/Virindi. The antechamber to the sliver room is very difficult to negotiate: Guards and Rampagers will block the narrow entrance corridor three deep, and lag will pop heroes in and amongst them, but not let them run through in an orderly way.  Luring the mob out of the antechamber is unpredictable -- they often get stuck on each other.  <I> -- Doc Feelgood 12/11/2001 </i><br>Level cap removed.

Has the pyreal pillars that one needs to chip off a sliver from, using the chisel given by Ecorto. Toughest foes are Raveners and Innocent Dolls - the rewards is the Doll Leader Charm, a bracelet with War IV and Focus IV. <I> -- Immacolata</i><br>Very easy dungeon with level 6 buffs.  My level 34 spear life item guy had no probs even with his own buffs.  The toughest spot (besides the end room) is maybe 4 ravs at once with 2 dolls.  Mostly it is 2 dolls at a time or 3 ravs at a time. Very easy to find end room. I took west hallway and always take the down and North option.  The only place this doesnt work (a large room with those small niches lining the walls) take an east passageway, and then continue with the down and north advice, after you pass three little cave rooms with a mound in the middle of the floor you are at the end. <I> -- Spearit of WE 10/12/2001 </i><br>Entrance/Exit is quiet, foyer is quiet.

Go in with nothing else but your chisel and 5 cheap gems.  Get a level 6 or 7 life buff, which wont help on the Hollow Lugians, but sure will help with the virindi war spells.  RUN LIKE HELL DUE NORTH.  You cnat get lost, just dodge a few Luginas and virindi, and as soon as you get to the room with the chlorozite pillar, go to peace mode and use ur chisel as many times as you can b4 it breaks.  I got 3 pieces this way easy, then LS recall, or be killed by the horde that has now gathered and it killing you.  We also went in with three meleers and a mage, and owned this place.

You also have to be sprayed by an Eviscerator at the end of the north dam hive (which only lasts for 90 minutes).  Once inside, proceed to the bottom and defeat the Queen.

Basically, the bug caused them to go to the top of the monster's hate list. Wi called it the Wi flag, and I got him to autograph my healer's heart in-game on Frostfell just before he quit the game. This was several years ago. <i>Geomancer, 2-17-2005</i>

First part of the three dungeon Quiddity Ingot quest introduced in march 2002s Persuassion patch. Theme is to go down down down down untill bottom. If you run up, its the wrong way. Foes are siroccos, therals and tsurics, strange combo elementals of ice and fire, acid and lightning. They resist my 349 life magic almost all the time, and my 383 war pretty darn often. And I hit for 20-30 pts. Slashing seemed to work better. Baning all 4 elements seems to be a good idea. One of the therals at the bottom drops a Ring of a Singularity Key. Pick this up and get to next dungeon, Venomous Nidus, for 2nd part of the key. <I> -- Immacolata</i>

In a desert region, I came upon a suspended walkway hung out from the edge of a cliff.  The other end of the walkway was attached not to solid ground but was lost in the spinning light of a portal.  I held my breath and stepped upon the walkway, half expecting it to collapse and throw me to the ground so far below. Yet, the walkway held my weight.  I crept forward and stepped through the portal.  I arrived on another walkway, or perhaps the same one somehow extended through the portal.  There was a platform at its far end, then another walkway... Well, it is something you must see for yourself.  Suffice it to say that I journeyed through this structure, all the while being assailed by vile creatures. Near the top of this construction I spied an artifact- a tall pedestal it was, with arcane shapes gyrating in the air above it. I know not its function but it was clear to me that this artifact, this device, is of some import. There are many things it could be and none, I believe, of small consequence. Before I was able to reach it, a wretched monster sent me back to my Lifestone.  Later, I attempted to return, yet the portal would not permit me to pass. I know not why.""<br>Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""I must study this device. I call it the ""Arcane Pedestal."" I even believe I have the means to create a version of it, but first I require an imprint of its morphology.""<br>Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""I shall give you a copy of my notes and an Imaging Crystal. The notes show you the way to that place. The Imaging Crystal can be imprinted with the composition and design of this device.  Return to me with the imprint embedded within the Crystal and I will study it and determine how to create it.""<br>Slithe Tradittor tells you, ""The Arcane Pedestal.

!4955,The Floating City,Dungeon,3.7S,68.5W,0S,0E,12/3/2002,<level>1-126</level><exit></exit> Destination: . Yes this is a random dungeon, yes there are allready a billion and one entries for it, yes I am apolagising for entering another one, but I tried several times to add to the Floating City (Primary) thread and managed only to put in one line... so here is what I was trying to say, assuming this adds itself. There is far too much speculation and roumour on this thread, so, since I know virtually everything there is to know about the city, let me set a few things straight. Firstly, portals may now be tied and recalled to, they cant be summoned but if you see one on the landscape, tie to it, and camp it for any friends who may want to tie too (random portals only disapear when the landblock resets, so if your watching the portal it wont go anywhere). Secondly, there is no pattern to the portals apearing, they are RANDOM. Thirdly, multiple portals can spawn on the surface, the city is broken up into 8 different landblocks (7 called The Floating City, and one The Golem Sanctum), and I think all of them can be created as random landscape portals. I think the golem sanctum only spawns in the dires but I cant confirm that). Thus all these reports saying when you enter go this way are useless because it all depends on which part of the city you have entered. Now, when you enter the city, your first step is to do a /loc and work out which landblock your in, then before jumping off anything or going through any portals, check ACMaps.com which has maps of the city (done by yours truely). So far Ive only done 6, Im waiting on the random portals to take me back to the final two landblocks. That raises another point, many of the portals between the different parts of the city are random as well, which is why you should tie to the first one you found, as you may not be able to get back to explore more. Inside the city, all exit portals, and lots of the internal portals (all helpfully called just The Floating City) are random, but unlike random portals on the surface, they are allways in the same place, but every month (on patch day) they change their destination. On the maps I have made all portals are identified as either stable or random, stable portals all have a return portal next to them to facilitate two way travel. Lockpicking is not required, but does make a little more of the city accessible, it is I believe posible to get everywhere by random portals but random portals are of course random. The toughest door is resistance 322, and worth picking if you can because it leads on to a stable portal to another section. There are what apears to be two significant points of interest in the city, one is the golem sanctum, an absolute labyrinth of tightly twisting passages and more junctions than I can count, all filled with Iron golems, and at the end one obsidian with a dispell trap and a chest of crap loot. The other point of interest is something everyone should see at least once in their life, a floating advocate tower in the direlands (3.7S / 69.2W), about as high above the ground as the tou-tou lighthouse is tall, and with a bright pink energy fountain inside it. On top is a random portal to the direlands somewhere. At the begining of the Golem Sanctum is a stable portal back to the city, and a random direlands portal, I have seen these portals go to North Direlands Valley Junction, and my old favorite hunting ground North Direlands Land Bridge. During this months patch I also found a portal whos name and location I didnt write down, but the drop was so hot I died before I materialised. Shortly after that they did a server rollback and the portal changed again. Within the city you will find a number of Strained Books, which cannot be picked up but give you some interesting lore about the place, and some interesting insights into the Empyrians past. In all I would say this whole place is priety much a place only to come if you like exploring and lore, the monsters inside are for the most part, low level undead and a few banderlings, there are 2 virindi servants, and 2 revanants, and thats about it for the high level monsters. However, it does make a wonderful alternative to the Abandoned Mines as a subway, because while the portals change every month, there are a lot of exit portals and they drop you in often rare towns like Kara. A few non town portals spawn, but rarely, and all Ive noticed is Heartland which has to be one of the most common random portals (and the most boring). Anyways, Im begining to ramble on without really saying much, so I will just say that the floating city is a great place to visit, and a nice place to tie to and use as a subway (incidentally the exit portals can be tied to and summoned, so when you find a Kara portal, take a copy of it for your guild, its a nice quiet town that sells level 6 scrolls for those rich enough to afford them). Should anyone be interested in learning more, go take a look at ACMaps.coms maps and post a message on this thread, I look at it occasionally, alternatively if your on harvestgain, just tie to the city and use it to get arround, Im sure well bump into each other there (tho its never happened yet, portals in are VERY rare).

!5107,Ulgrim's Basement,Dungeon,94.8S,9.7W,0S,0E,5/4/2003,<level>1+</level><exit></exit> Destination: . This dungeon is found in the basement floor of Ulgrims Cottage on Ulgrims Island, which is accessible by either using Ulgrims Recall Spell or giving the Drunken Madman in the tower near Baishi a mug of Winter Lager bought from the barkeep in Nanto.<br>When approached, Ulgrim will ask you to fetch him a mug of his special Home Brew in his basement.  Enter through the portal in his basement and marvel at the amazing array of decorations on the walls and floors, probably the most impressively decorated place in all of AC.  Some of the items are recognizeable, some arent, some are unusual (like Ulgrims vast collection of monster heads), and some are just silly (like the Holy Handgrenade of Antioch, specially imbued with the Rabbit Slayer property).  This dungeons worth seeing just for the decorations, if nothing else.<br>There are many items to get in this dungeon, the primary one being the Home Brew.  Take the Home Brew to Ulgrim (dont drink it -- 14 day timer.) and hell give you the Casting Stein that has a mana C bonus of 7% and also casts Stam to Mana IV.  While killing your way through the dozens of tiny white and brown mice (which respawn like crazy and have extremely high attack skill, even though they do little damage), youll randomly find a Golden Key, which unlocks all the locked chests and doors in the basement.  All locked chests and doors are easily pickable, as well, so the key is not necessary for LP characters.  They also sometimes drop a block of cheese, which is ironic as its 50 times the size of the mouse carrying it.<br>The Golden Key can be used on either of Ulgrims storage chests, in which one can find the Hangover Cure, an Ust, Stout, Winter Lager, and Peppermint sticks.  Alternately it can be used to unlock the Treasure Room door which is hidden behind a wall of tapestries near the storage chests.  Behind the Treasure Room Door is a room full of glittering piles of Treasure (worth 200k and hookable on floor hooks -- 28 day timer), a Golden Gromnie inscribed by Ulgrim (no timer, but unusable for purchasing mansions), and a Lock Box that contains a simple gold ring inscribed by Ulgrim with the message Lo Bnaseuim (28 day timer).<br>Upon returning to Ulgrim, you can give him almost any item found in his dungeon and hell say funny and witty things, most notably doing his Gollum impersonation when you give him the gold ring.  Also, if you give him the Peppermint sticks, hell give you a Peppermint Pumpkin Pie that drains 20 points of stamina when eaten. <I> -- Confucius of FF</i>

If youve done most of the Lost Husband quest that starts in Ayan Baqur with the NPC named Aaminah, it will portal you into a dungeon with 4 trials. The first is a Lockpick trial which requires you to have LP and have it buffed pretty high (300+) or else it will drain away your health. The 2nd is a room full of rolling balls of death with wood platforms hovering above... you must jump from one to the other without falling or youll die and your corpse will be 100% unrecoverable. The 3rd is a room with a target on one end, you on the other, and a lava pit between. Use a bow, xbow, or wand to strike the target with a critical hit. The last room is a rather difficult logic puzzle, which might possibly be bugged (4 of us did it and our answer we all arrived at separately was wrong). Look it up online and avoid a lot of frustration :) Solving this takes you to a room with the new Oswalds Dirk, possibly in a pickable chest... I didnt make it this far because of the bugged puzzle, so I might be wrong on where it is. No word on where the lost husband really is, though, or why Ulgrims acting so guilty. -- Confucius of FF <I> -- Doc Feelgood</i><br>Entrance is mildly hot. Dungeon itself has nothing to fight -- its a jump-and-puzzle dungeon. If you fail the first room puzzle and survive, heal up and try again, theres no timer on trying the puzzle.  There are several chests in the final Dirk Room, some are pickable. Just entering this dungeon flags you as ready for the follow-on quest, Heart of Innocence, and there you learn the lost husbands fate. <I> -- Doc Feelgood 8/9/2003 </i>

A fairly straightforward, if not excessively long and boring dungeon, this place gets you the Living Tome, a cool floor-hookable furniture item.  Inside are all Falatacot Consorts, Patricians, and Matriarchs, more and more the further you go in.  Near the bottom, you know youre going the right way if you go down some spiral staircases.  At the end is the Falatacot Abbess, whos level 161 and has 4000 HP.  She doesnt drop anything of note, but beyond her is the Living Tome, which you just use to get your own.  No camping needed.  Respawn is quick, though, and theres a LOT of them, so I recommend bringing a group of at least 4-5 uber players, if not a small army.  Their swords and spells do a lot of damage, so bane for all physicals and buff your acid or bludgeon weapons.  When this quest first debuted, you could give the living tome to Nuhmudira for a global and a book of lore, but then she leaves. <I>-- Confucius of FF 11/7/2003</i>

Use the Odd Looking Vine at bottom the temple to teleport you into the dungeon. <I>-- ZTK 3/10/2004</i><br>This is the first in a series of Fellowship quests.  The level breaks are 40-69, 70-99, and 100+   Puzzles and trials lead to the High Matriarch Ixir Zi.  One of your felowship members must be the Victim who uses the 4 Eyes to bring the Matriarch out.  The Eyes massively debuff the Victim and continually drain them.  I believe the draining only starts when they have 0 stamina.  I strongly suggest that the victim logs out for the duration of the battle.  They have 15 minutes to rejoin and will be much safer.  Make sure to have a couple people wait in the Boss room to refellow and Heal the victim.  Send the rest of the people into the reward room to battle the few Burun present.  Afterward your Victim may enter, but make sure that they wait out the debuffs before getting their reward.  The Sarcophagus casts a drain spell as it gives you the Ancient Armored Vestment.  You then have a choice of an Axe, Sword, Mage Staff, Thrown Weapon Brace, Crown, and a Mansion Portal to Kivik Lirs Temple.  <I>-- Taarna Blood SC 10/14/2004</i>

Fortunately my dear friend Micon has agreed to give me shelter until I am back upon my feet.<br><br>Bachus Flufens tells you, They must hold that relic in high esteem indeed. A most fanciful folk, I must say. I heard that it is a legendary spear that they dismantled and enshrined in two separate caverns on the island. It once belonged to a warrior from an opposite faction, I believe. He tried to persuade them back to traditional ways, but they would have none of it. Somehow they dispatched him but retained his spear...which is supposed to have some sort of magical, living properties to it. Im not quite sure what to believe.<br><br>Bachus Flufens tells you, Perhaps the answer could be found in the caverns to the northwest along the shore.  Try the area around 40.2N 84.7W --at least thats where I saw the Tumeroks heading last. Beware, friend--its quite likely to be well guarded. Id go myself, but I must catch up on my journal today.

!5987,Insatiable Vault,Dungeon,97.4N,48W,0S,0E,7/7/2005,<level>125+</level><exit></exit> Destination: . This is the location of the Insatiable Eater's Jaw, which is needed for the Augmentation Gem quest.  Entry is safe.  Jump directly into the pit and proceed down until you find a large room with a dark floor and a pit.  There are several down ramps that lead in circles or to dead ends, but when you find the pit you can jump down.  There are 3 jumps down in total if I recall correctly.  After the last pit, you will find an area with a Surface portal at the bottom of a ramp.  Before going down the ramp, go to the left or the right and into a dead end wing.  There is an unmarked Insatiable Eater there.  It has the Jaw and you even get a helpful message when you kill it.  The timer is 21 days.   <I>-- Taarna Blood 7/7/2005</I>The jaw can also be turned in for 40 million xp, 2 MMD notes, and a title token for the title Insatiable Slayer. <I>-- Chupon 7/22/2005</I>
