      "description": "Al-Arqas was at one time an arrival point for new Isparians. However, the outposts and advocate spires were destroyed by Martine long ago. The town is now scarcely populated, as there are few unique NPCs here, and quicker routes have opened up to the Gharu'ndim master mage, such as Xarabydun. The A'mun Desert is a hostile place, reminiscent of the trackless Naqut on Ispar. The dunes stretch beneath the sweltering sun for mile upon mile, with little water or hope of shelter. Even within such harsh lands, however, there are rare islands of succor: oases where fresh water miraculously bubbles forth, creating motes of greenery amid the wastes. Such a place is Al-Arqas (literally, \"The Haven\"), which sprang into being only recently, when Gharu'ndim desert-walkers discovered a hitherto unknown spring in the A'mun's southern expanses. Though less than half a year old, the town is already flourishing, as it provides a convenient halfway-point for travelers moving between Yaraq an southern towns like Uziz and Khayyaban. Points of Interest The Djubar Amitri, a pool of fresh, surprisingly cool water, forms the heart of the oasis where Al-Arqas has arisen. Though it is small, the spring that feeds it keeps it filled, even during the dry season. Less than a year ago, the pool began to emit clouds of cold mist. The reason for this is unknown, though doomsayers claim it heralds a coming disaster. In the dunes east of the oasis, a portal leads to an old compound once used by the Empyrean to train their young in the arts of war. The portal was buried beneath the sands intil shortly after the Gharu'ndim first arrived in Dereth, when a storm uncovered it. For a time, bandits dwelt within, but they were driven out when the desert folk settled Al-Arqas. Now, Drudges prowl its empty vaults.",

      "description": "Some of the Gharu'ndim who first came to Dereth were lifelong desert-dwellers, and chafed at the idea of building their homes on the Yushad Ridge. Their leader, a wizard named Raqur al-Hayra, led them on a trek acrss the A'mun Desert to a cove along the coast of the Inner Sea. There they found an oasis, an island of green amid the sands. Raqur thrust his staff into the ground, bringing forth fresh water, and declared that all the desert folk would be welcome in this place. Sadly, Raqur was slain in a magic duel with a Mu-miyah archmage before the town, called Yaraq, was completed. Yaraq has since remained apart from much of the rest of Dereth, seperated from the rest of the island by desert, although portal and paths do lead to lands beyond the dunes. Points of Interest The Desert Way is the only sure path across the trackless A'mun, whose sands would quickly bury any ordinary road. Its markers, upright hoops hung with cloth, lead from the end of Yaraq's north road to the village of Tufa, and beyond to the towns of the Yushad Ridge. A series of rocky buttes rise from the peninsula on the southern edge of the Yaraq Cove. A colony of Drudges and other monsters have dug their warrens in the soft stone of one of these mesas.

It was one of the original starter towns until Martine destroyed the arrival points at the east and south outposts. Rithwic was the original home of one of the Lugian gem sellers, but he has since moved to Holtburg. Rithwic has portals to Holtburg, Lytelthorpe, and Shoushi. In the center of town there is a portal leading to the once hidden underground town Martine's Retreat. Asheron's Call Manual Text First Settled in 7 P.Y., Rithwic is one of the youngest Aluvian towns. Originally a small stonemason's hamlet built near a ford of the River Prosper, just downstream from Lake Blessed, it has grown quickly into a thriving boomtown, as it is the gateway to the Sho communities to the south. It once stood on the edge of the Aluvian lands, but the frontier has since moved south to Dryreach, leaving Rithwic more or less unmolested by the Tumerok raiders that harry the hinterlands. In the past year, a second settlement, dubbed East Rithwic, has arisen on the river's other side.",

This all changed in the shadow wars, when Arwic was destroyed by a Shadow Spire. After the attack the residents of the town moved down the roads to the South and West. The gaping crater remained unoccupied for years, until the town was rebuilt newer and stronger from the ruins, laden with walls. However, some the townspeople didn't not move back into the walled city and remain in the buildings outside the town. Nuhmudira planned to make a school in Arwic supposedly in the currently empty villas you see on the east side of town. However, her plans apparently never came to fruition because after many years no school has yet to open and the buildings remain empty."

Overlooking town is a small keep, which is often used as a meeting place. Original Manual Text One of Dereth's newest towns, until a few months ago Lytelthorpe was nothing but an abandoned Empyrean Fortress overrun by Banderlings, led by a human warmonger named Wardiel the Mighty. Recently, however, a band of brave warriors and wizards slew Wardiel, drove out the infestation and claimed the keep as their own. Since then, shops and homes have arisen in the fortress's shadow. Wilder and younger than nearby Rithwic, Lytelthorpe has yet to establish itself. Surrounded as it is by rich farmland, however, it promises to come into its own with the passage of time. Points of Interest Lytelthorpe Keep was built long ago by the Empyrean. At Present, little is known if its history - not even its original name. Until recently, it was overrun by a clan of Banderlings, and had fallen into disrepair. It has been restored and is now claimed by Lord Aleval, one of the towns' liberators. An unusual subterranean complex lies beneath the rolling, fertile hills south of town. It appears to be an ancient distillery, constructed by the Empyrean to brew exotic liquors. What drink remains, after the passage of centuries, would be of great value to connoisseurs. In order to retrieve it, however, delvers will have to brave drudges and other beasts who now stalk he halls.",

In that time, a master swordsman named Ben Ten roamed the land, giving aid to those who needed it. Ben Ten Vanished into legend soon after the Tumerok menace was thrawted The Last place he was seen was standing atop a large rock near the edge of the swamp, and some of his followers settled there considering the stone to have been blessed by is presence. The village that arose on that spot - called Yanshi or \"town of the boulder\" - has grown in the past several years into a trading center, with roads leading into both the Gharu'ndim and Aluvian lands as well as deeper into the Sho realm. Points of Interest The Sacred Stone, found in the midst of Yanshi, is the last known place where the swordsman Ben Ten was seen. Some folk, however, claim to have sighted him since. In the time before Ben Ten came, many of those who would one day settle in Yanshi tried to hide from the Tumerok scourge in a subterranean dungeon complex. The dungeon, however, was rife with monsters that slew many of those seeking shelter. The survivors claim that the creatures that drove them out remain in those catacombs. .",

Nearby are several Tumerok training camps belonging to their various clans. Dryreach is the starting point for a few quests, such as the Overlord's Sword, Dryreach Rescue, and the Tumerok Gladiator killtask. It is also the home of one of the two Tumerok Collectors on Dereth, the other being located in Fort Tethana. Until recently, the only way to get to Dryreach was to run. Now there is a portal to Dryreach in Holtburg. Be sure to bring a Dryreach Key with you (purchased from the weary looking man in Rithwic or Eastham) unless you know how to pick locks or are able to leap over the town's walls."

The compound was built at the foot of an old Empyrean tower (which doubled as a watchtower) to watch over the mountain pass from Shoushi to Qalaba'r. As time passed, a safer route was found through the mountains from Nanto, through Lin and eventually to Qalaba'r. As a result, Baishi's focus changed from commerce to mining and logging. The woods around Baishi provide abundant resources if you can guard yourself from the many Drudges, Banderlings, and Mosswarts that seem to continually infest the pass. The merchants and craftsmen here manage to supply the basic needs and then some. There are still a few of the old merchants that retain the skills that were so valuable to them in those days as well as the odd collector or two who still desire to fill their need for that missing item, including a collector specializing in wasp wings."

      "description": "Quest(s): Focusing Stone, Diemos Flagging, Crafter Golems. A written history of the Mines of Despair. Not long ago, in a time I remember as if it were just yesterday, the mines provided us with wealth and happiness. We were called to the mines in the name of greed and our insatiable desire for a life our ancestors set upon us. It was as if happiness itself was being mined from the rich veins in those tunnels. Every day we picked and cracked those tunnels open forcing them to reveal their wealth. Our wealth. It was a glorious era. We had estates draped in gold and we wore clothes adorned with glitter and jewels. When we walked our feet fell upon walkways made of precious stone. When we drank it was from goblets of polished silver. The very essence of the mine oozed itself into our living rooms and we welcomed it as a child lost in the night. Then the day came when we forced the mine to reveal much more than the wealth It had been hiding from us. Our miners had broken down a wall revealing an ancient tunnel. We assumed the Empyreans erected it long ago, as we had found evidence of their prior existence in the mine before. In the beginning we expected to find chambers filled with ancient Empyrean riches. Perhaps even relics left behind. But when three seasoned miners didn't return from the tunnels we knew something sinister had happened. Four of our best warriors entered the tunnels with the hope of finding the lost miners. At the very least, we wanted to know what awaited us down there. We still had visions of chambers glittering with treasure and rare relics. The following day we had our answer. Only one warrior emerged from the mine's opening, bruised and battered from a battle so fierce it should have left him dead. He stumbled forward and collapsed before our feet. It took days before the warrior was well enough to speak. When his fever had finally broke, he told us what had happened in the tunnels below. There were no rooms glittering with treasure. No lost relics from a past civilization. The warrior spoke only of men who death had touched but had not taken. He spoke of rotted and fleshless men who had taken up arms in the name of something unearthly. The decision soon came down from the town council. We were to abandon the mine and lock the entrance. The very thing that once sustained our town had destroyed us. It placed a pox upon everyone and everything. Our town coffers dried up, our crops died, and over time even the most stubborn person left town. Only I remain to tell this story and to warn others from entering the Mines of Despair. -- Le-Ai Rea Location submitted by Arjin of Morningthaw. Thanks!",

Many of the Monougas are actually inside the buildings and on the roof and they seem to have the decency to stay there rather than jump down and swarm you so it's easy enough to pick your fights.

      "description": "The origins of this fortress are a mystery. It appears to be of Isparian Construction but no one is sure who built it. One theory is that some faction of the Aluvians built the structure. However they discovered to their dismay that it was built atop some ancient Empyrean ruins. Shortly after it reached its current stage of construction undead began to appear in the fortress` cellars and harrass the trespassers, eventually driving them out. At some point after that, a tribe of banderlings took up residence, thus making this one of the few locations where a banderling chief can be found. It`s assumed that while the zombies found here harass the banderling ravers, breeders, and raiders within and scouts and guards without, the banderlings pay them no mind, being content to just leave the cellars of the fort to the undead.",

The area is filled with terrible creatures, the most fearsome of which are Virindi, tuskers, golems, and gromnies.  The small building houses three shopkeepers, but beware, in this remote outpost prices are very high.  All three women are followers of Jojii and are placid and welcoming despite their awful surroundings. Ximi Nu, the weaponsmith sells a basic assortment of amour and weapons as befits her Sho heritage, as well as whatever odd rag-tag pieces that passing adventurers might sell to her.  Be on your guard, though, as hapless customers are all too frequently attacked by creatures as they attempt to do their trading. The healer, Kan Chi Gai, keeps a small counter here selling basic healing services and a few potions and healing supplies.  Her kind words of support and warning will help heal the soul as well. Dou Ran the mage is an odd zealot selling a limited supply of spell components and alchemical items.  She will speak quixotically of the Disaster Maze which lies to the east of town, but one is left with the impression that she has been isolated in this remote wilderness for too long.  She does, however, sell scrolls of lifestone recall, claiming to have learned the secrets of the spell while within the maze. Thanks to Tamera of Frostfell for this location's details!",

Maybe someday it will be reclaimed. Until then it remains a tomb. A single adventurer of level 5-10 will have little difficulty with this location. The fact that the drudges stay is seperated packs makes this is dungeon ideal for any sized group of low level characters to explore.

At the top of the hill you will find more bones and skeletons as well as a large Empyrean style head with a green mist surrounding it. Lore: This is actually the Battlefield of Ayn Tayan where the various undead factions banded together to fight Bael'Zharon and give the Asheron and the other Yalaini Mages time to construct their crystal array trap for Bael. The battle raged for three days was a victory for the undead because they were able to hold off Bael long enough for the Yaliani to complete their trap but the undead forces were completely devastated by the battle. During this battle the Sand King Anadil managed to destroy one of the original Shadow Spires. The four Cairns and the green mist mark where the Sand King Nerash was slain by Leikotha who fought on the shadows side in order to get vengeance against Nerash for turning her into an undead. Another lore figure that died at Ayn Tayan was Jaera who was killed by Bael'Zharon himself and who's tomb is now found at the Mage Academy. Notable lore figures that fought in the battle were: Aerfalle Anadil Bael'Zharon Geraine IV Isin Dule Jaera (Killed) Leikotha Nerash (Killed) Rytheran The best source of lore about the battle at Ayn Tayan is from Aerfalle's Letter.",

Initially elated, his joy turned to deep disappointment when he found the walls undefended and no one within. He spent years hiding here in the towers until the liberation came, and thereafter vowed to never return to such a forsaken place. Much later, a small Aluvian faction left the safety of Cragstone to come north (some say they were kicked out of the town). They took up residence within the Bandit Castle, but some disagreement split their ranks, and a number of them trekked down the road and wound up here, at Foster's Fort. A woman called simply Neydisa led their ranks. She saw a grand palace in what looked otherwise like a ruined husk. Though Neydisa and her followers had few supplies, and Neydisa herself passed on long before the era of the Lifestones, this place was gradually converted into a place where people may rest in peace and safety. People now call it Neydisa Castle. We who live here keep to ourselves. We seek to live in peace and simplicity. We have no need to venture beyond our walls, for we have all that we need within.",

The Black Spawn Dens were popular leveling areas until supplanted by the Marae Lassel Olthoi dungeons in the Oct 2001 Dark Majesty expansion and finally the Aphus Lassel Tusker Dungeons in Nov 2002. The portal entry requires level 20+. Entry is neither a safe nor hot drop. Tuskers can and do get into the first room, epsecially if dragged into the room by other players. The first area is comprised of Tusker Slaves. As you go back the dungeon divides into a right and left area with the left area being the larger of the two. About half way into the dungeon Tusker Guards appear. In the right area is a virindi puppet in the last room. Thanks to Morgan the Stout for pointing out this location.",

You allow Aun Shimauri to examine your Hea Totem. Aun Shimauri tells you, I`m sorry, friend, but this totem is obviously of Hea craftmanship. See its inferior carving? The totems I am seeking to restore to my people are made of greenstone, opal, and obsidian.

Did Micon or Lark tell you that I've been spending time with the Tumeroks? A most fanciful folk, I must say! Why, just the other day one of the Hea told me about a legendary spear they dismantled and enshrined in two separate parts of the island. It once belonged to a warrior from an opposite faction, I believe. He tried to persuade them back to traditional ways, but they would have none of it. Somehow they dispatched him but retained his spear...which is supposed to have some sort of magical, living properties to it. I'm not quite sure what to believe. Bachus Flufens tells you, Perhaps the answer could be found in the caverns to the northwest along the shore.  Try the area around 44 North, 87 West--at least that's where I saw my new Tumerok acquaintences heading last. Beware, friend--it sounded as if they held this artifact in high esteem, and it's quite likely to be well guarded. I'd go myself, but I must catch up on my journal today. If you would like to read it, here are a few pages that I wrote the other day. Bachus Flufens gives you Bachus Flufen's Journal. After September 2005 Bachus Flufens tells you, Woe is me! As if it were not bad enough that I was driven out of my farm to the west by the Hea, now Varicci has taken over my town!

Were you to take this task on yourself, you will bear witness to things I have seen and a wondrous device I glimpsed but could not fathom or grasp. For you see, there is an artifact in a place unlike any that exists in Dereth. I am an explorer for the Explorer Society. In a desert region, I came upon a suspended walkway hung out from the edge of a cliff. The other end of the walkway was attached not to solid ground but was lost in the spinning light of a portal. I held my breath and stepped upon teh walkway, half expecting it to collapse and throw me to the ground so far below. Yet, the walkway held my weight! I crept forward and stepped through the portal. I arrived on another walkway, or perhaps the same one somehow extended through the portal. There was a platform at its far end, then another walkway... Well, it is something you must see for yourself. Suffice it to say that I journeyed through this structure, all the while being assailed by vile creatures. Near the top of this construction I spied an artifact- a tall pedestal it was, with arcane shapes gyrating in the air above it. I would know not its function but it was clear to me that this artifact, this device, is of some import. There are many things it could be and none, I believe, of small consequence! Before I was able to reach it, a wretched monster send me back to my Lifestone! Later, I attempted to return, yet the portal would not permit me to pass. I know not why. I must study this device. I call it the Arcane Pedestal. I even believe I have the means to create a version of it, but first I require an imprint of its morphology. I shall give you a copy of my notes and Imaging Crystal. The notes show you the way to that place. The Imaging Crystal can be imprinted with the composition and design of this device. Return to me with the imprint embedded within the Crystal and I will study it and determine how to create it. The Aracane Pedestal! We shall have the Arcane Pedestal!",

They seem to guard the area against all other creatures. Ive never seen Grievvers build a nest, but I think thats just what they are doing. Perhaps the lack of Shadow infulence for so long is allowing them to return to a more natural existence. If you think yourself brave enough I would be very grateful to know what they are doing in the far east of the valley. I am very interested in insect trophies and body parts. You can learn much about a creature from its remains. If you have any I would greatly enjoy looking them over. Dont worry Ill return them after Ive examined them. I do however have a powerful appetite and cannot make the same assurances about food. Haha! This I know for a fact. The Grievvers cannot abide the presence of Olthoi. They will fight fiercely against them whenever the two come in contact. This leads me to believe that the Grievvers and Olthoi share some common origin. Did you see that? A little Grievver! I wonder if its a different species or just a juvenile. I believe that the Grievvers have a complex social order. I can often see one deferring to another in combat or during feeding. Yet it doesnt appear to be a purely physical hierarchy since Ive seen a smaller Grievver receive deferential treatment. Perhaps they also recognize intelligence or magical ability as dominating traits. Its all very interesting! No, I cant have a campfire. It might attract the Grievvers. Small price to pay really.",

Blind Snowman tells you, I was standing in a meadow minding my own business, taking in the scenery, when BAM I get whacked with something from behind. Blind Snowman tells you, Shoom! Shoom! Both my eyes go flying from my head and I can't see. Then I hear two distinct voices. One was chiding the other to apologize and the other one was laughing all crazy and mean. The mean voice said that was the funniest thing it had ever seen and to shut up or it would do the same to the nicer voice. Blind Snowman tells you, People these days! If you see my eyes around would you please bring them to me? I would be very appreciative. You give Blind Snowman A Lump of Coal. Blind Snowman tells you, What's this? Blind Snowman tells you, Wohoo! Thank you! I'll be able to make a new set of eyes once this gets cold enough! Blind Snowman tells you, You deserve a reward for your good deed. Let's see... well not see per se... one second. The Blind Snowman scoops up a pile of snow and casts a spell. The snow coalesces forming ice crystals that shift and rearrange as if alive. Blind Snowman gives you Snowman Snowglobe. Blind Snowman tells you, I can't be sure it turned out exactly right, but I hope you like it. Blind Snowman tells you, May your bottom stay cold and your eyes stay put. Soon I'll be able to see the snow again! Blind Snowman says, Much more of this and I'm going to become an Unhappy Snowman. The Blind Snowman swallows the Lump of Coal with a contented smile. Blind Snowman says, Who's there? I..I've got an icicle! Blind Snowman tells you, People these days! If you see my eyes around would you please bring them to me? I would be very appreciative.

This mage, located just outside of Glendon Wood, seems to know a great deal about the frozen sword in the dais located within the town proper. Perhaps she will give you clues as to its origin and how to free it from its chilly home. Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, Hello. I am Mage Syltyn Rillon, a member of the Explorer Society. Perhaps you are wondering about the sword on the dais in town. I had been a friend of Martine's back on Ispar.  I encountered Martine here, during one of his mad rampages. He knew not who I was, nor did he seem to care and the encounter ended badly for me. Upon arriving at the Lifestone I was angry, yet understood that the Virindi were principally at fault for causing Martine's actions. I became determined to help fellow Isparians combat the Virindi and other perils of this harsh land. With the help of Omaro Nagate the weaponsmith, I crafted a frost sword that should be of good utility to adventurers who are skilled in the ways of the blade. Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, To obtain this weapon you must first prove your worthiness. There is a Virindi complex north of Bandit Road. I left a note on a tree along Bandit Road, east of Neydisa Castle, marking the location where you should turn north. Go to the complex, navigate through it and bring to me a Virindi Signet. I shall then allow you to take the sword. Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, Oh, take this.  It will aid you in your journey through part of the complex. Read it carefully. Mage Syltyn Rillon gives you A Tale of Paths.",

      "description": "Quest(s): Search for Gareth Dain. Where the Book of Memories is found. A book made of Sclavus skins. I've escaped from the undead woman that rules the Sclavus here, at least for now. After I awoke, the pain receded enough for me to search the room. I found a dead man in the corner and dressed him in my clothes, leaving him on the stone table where I had awakened. Perhaps she would think me dead, if not I could hopefully escape before she found me. I followed the passage out, but it came to a dead end. That's when I remembered a word she had spoken when leaving, \"ahkree\". The wall blocking the passage vanished when I spoke the word. Every move I made hurt and I was sure that her Sclavus would cut me down before I made it to the surface. Strangely, the Sclavus seemed unconcerned with my passing, they merely watched me searching the crypt rooms and passages. They would not let me leave the lower levels. They blocked my attempts to get by them, and I was too weak to overpower them. I continued my search through the crypts rooms and found this hidden room. I found a discarded Sclavus skin that serves now to hold these words. I can only hope the undead woman doesn't know of this room. The pain is returning an I must sleep now. I cannot escape. There are too many Sclavus guarding the exits to these crypts, if a crypt is what this place is. I have seen the Sclavus praying and performing complicated rituals in the room with the bloody altar. The pain in my chest grows worse by the hour; my skin itches and burns. I feel safe in my hidden room here and I have found food of a sort, but I must find a way to get by the guards and escape or I fear I will die. It's difficult to think clearly through the pain. I must concentrate, perhaps I noticed something when I arrived. I should start at the beginning. My friend Dalius warned me not to go. In talks of his adventures he had mentioned an old temple he had found in the south dires infested with Sclavus. I found the idea of discovering a lost temple and killing some Sclavus in the process irresistible. Dalius told me not to go, that it was too dangerous, I laughed at his caution and told him that I would kill the Sclavus even if he could not. If only I had listened to him. I found the sandstorm he had talked of and sought its eye. I easily dispatched the Sclavus I encountered before reaching the temple. It was then that the Sclavus ambushed me. They had been lying in wait, as if they knew of my arrival before hand. They overwhelmed me, capturing me easily. They beat me until I stopped struggling and I remember being dragged through a portal as I lost consciousness. When I came to I was stretched out on a cold stone table and could hear someone chanting in a strange language. It felt as if a giant hand pressed down on me, my breath became shallow. Something slid onto my stomach and curled there, then the pain came. Every muscle in my body spasmed in time with the chanting. As I wrote before, I awoke later and devised a way of escaping the room I had been locked in. I wish I had learned portal magic from my wife. She was always trying to teach me, but I've never been very good at magic. I will rest again and make another attempt to get by the guards tomorrow. My torch burned out and I awoke in the dark curled up in pain. Even without the torch I can see everything in a blinding red light, even though my eyes are clenched shut. My skin burns as if it is on fire and being flayed. I write my last words here in the hope that my wife may learn what happened to me. I love you Talira, I will always love you and I am sorry that I failed you. I would not risk our life together if I had it to do over. It is better that I die than continue in such agony. Know that my last thoughts were of you my love. I did not expect to ever wake again, my fever is gone and the pain has almost left me. We are so tired. I caught a rat from the cages to eat. I was so hungry that I forgot to cook it. On the way back, I saw my reflection in one of the pools and we see now that it would have been better if I had died. I have become something like the Sclavus and a pale reflection of the human we once were. Somehow I cannot bring myself to loathe my new form, perhaps it is her will that we are happy. I can hear her voice in the back of my mind. I now know that I have been hearing it for many days. She tells us to guard the temple and perform the rites. We are accepting of our new life. We, Gareth, still wishes that we remember him and his love, so we will write our memories down before they slip away. You were once a man named Gareth Dain. You were a brash warrior who loved his wife and his life with her. Her name was Talira Dain and she loved us deeply. Do not forget her, but never let her see us again for we are hideous in her eyes. I remember a day in the sun with Talira, we loved and life was good. I remember being warm and happy. I am so cold now. Do not let Talira know my fate. I am dead. -- Gareth Dain",

This essence is required to forge the new pyreal weapons, which we are calling Isparian. Alaine the Apprentice tells you, Here -- I have literature that explains all this. Alaine the Apprentice gives you Isparian Arms. Alaine the Apprentice gives you Treatise on Essence. Alaine the Apprentice tells you, The locations of the Research Facility and the Fathomless Chasm are written on the flyleaves.",

Special Properties: Attuned, Bonded May this book bear witness to my defection from the light. I am no longer one of the weak, no longer one of those who follow Asheron's ways. I make this choice of my own volition, embracing the ultimate freedom that is the birthright of all living beings. I cast even my name to the wind - no shackle shall hold my identity. I have chosen my path - the path of the strong. I do not follow some defeated power, as Bael'zharon was defeated. Nay - my allegiance is only to the strong, to that which will lead me to triumph! I remember hearing of my master for the first time. The thrill which ran through me...ah, as only power can thrill! I knew, though those who spoke of my future master spoke in enmity, that I had found truth in this world at last. The only truth in this world is strength, and there is no greater strength. Only my master can claim to be so strong. Those who follow the teachings of Isin Dule, they live a lie. They will be swallowed whole! They will be consumed as this paper is consumed by fire! *the rest of this page is burned away* The call! Oh, how they speak of the call which led us to this world, but another calls me. I cannot ignore it, nor do I want to! A call to ruin! A call to greatness! Why do they resist? I watched it all, watched the armies break. Some died forever...eaten. Fuel for my great master! Some were fortunate...changed despite themselves, given the gift I seek. Some were slain for the sake of slaughter. But none were allowed to escape. I feel insubstantial. I drift. I will no longer be what I am soon. I embrace the last moments of an old life and the beginning of a new existence. -- Unknown",

I couldn`t stand the hike, but I would often meet him at the Haliana settlement and we would walk the beach together.` Branwyn fights back another surge of tears and continues with her story.

There are scouts at these formations to the north, east, and west of the graveyard.\" Jondor Torgren tells you, \"I would be most indebted to you if you could somehow gain the trust of these scouts and bring me whatever written materials you can about the beliefs that their societies espouse. I would reward you with a bit of practical knowledge for any manifestoes that you could bring me. I have also heard that there are more senior representatives of each society in Ayan Baqur, but I doubt they'll talk to you until you've won the confidence of the scouts by the graveyard. Good luck! And be careful about straying into the graveyard itself!\"."

Too risky to be worth the pay.\" NOTE: As of 8/29/2008 you will maintain the number of ribbons turned into the Society and the timers on all Society quests, so it will take you even longer to rank up if you rejoin a society. In addition, you lose all rank in the old society! When you complete the join Society quest again, you receive the same amount of XP and a society armor writ (3 day timer on chest pulls)."

Also the Stabilizing Machine is still there. The door is now barricaded, but you can access it by going up near the Test Portal, and shift-jump down into a small gap in the floor. On the floor, there is a Scrap of Paper (Attuned and Bonded). I'm afraid, something dark, very dark is happening. Screams came from the depths of Mar'uun reaching across the chasm to me. A darkness spread acrosss Mar'uun. I've managed to baricade myself in the corner. I don't feel very safe, but I may be. I dream of rescue, were it possible. As I write this I can feel the darkness coming. (the writing on the note becomes unkempt) ...there's scratching above me... the note ends abruptly."

On the banks, birds lazily patrol the sky above the cathedral stands of old-growth trees, and ancient monoliths recline carelessly by fields of giant water lily. Year after year, the lake mysteriously keeps the same level, regardless of snow or rainfall. However, the static tranquility belies extreme hazards. Fierce monsters roam the lake shore and maintain eager watch on this portal, hoping to snare hapless adventurers. Legends surround the lake. It is rumored that the monster-infested caverns nearby link the crater to the outside slopes. What's more, the Sho have taken particular interest in the lake since a priest of the Unicorn related a strange bedtime tale to his Koutei's son. The priest claimed to know sorcerers who once created a glass citadel beneath a mountain lake. On calm, cloudless nights, the clear waters would focus starlight so that distant worlds could be viewed across the ether. Whether this story bears on the mysteries of Crater Lake may never be known, for the priest packed up and disappeared that very night, unexpectedly ending several decades of faithful service to his master.

One claimed that reminding him of his lost wife and home would help him shake off his stupor, while the other claimed that only by calling to his mind the power and strength given to him by the Virindi could he be awakened. In searching the town, the newcomers found two chambers, Martine's studies. One study seemed to be an expression of Martine's humanity, and on a desk in this study a letter to his wife was found. The other study appeared to be an expression of his Virindi side, a twisted room filled with the objects of Martine's hate. On the floor in this study, adventurers found a folded Tusker husk, the remnants of the first Tusker Martine had killed using his Virindi-enhanced magic. The newcomers found themselves with a choice, to remind Martine of his past on Ispar, or of his past on Dereth Letter For Melanay: Melanay, Every night I'm convinced I will wake up next to you, that all of this has been a dream.

The only way to initially access them is through a portal at the end of either the Devastated Falatacot Temple or the Corrupted Falatacot Temple, both on Aerlinthe. If you speak to Shemza before handing the Yellow Jewel you'll be flagged to use the the portal just west of Ayan Baqur at 60.3S 90.7W that takes you directly to the Gatekeepers (useful for returning once a week to loot the Black Marrow Reliquary chests). Note: Some people handed in the Yellow Jewel before talking to Shemza and aren't flagged to use the Ayan portal. A few people have had an +Envoy fix it for them, but others have been told they can't be helped. One way around this is to tie to the surface portal in any of the crystal dungeons, alternatively you can keep one of the Shards and show it to either of the Aerlinthe statues and it will also send you straight to the Gatekeepers like the Ayan portal does. The shard is not used up in the process so you can use it again to return the next time. NPCs: Shemza Lurza Dmesne Rhujun"

Eastham is an Aluvian town, near the outermost East Coast of Dereth at 17.5N, 63.4E Eastham was once a very busy town, with new adventurers crowding the beaches to hunt the gromnies and other beasts that lived there. The stronger warrios even made the long run to Arwic, once the trade hub for all of Dereth. These days, the town is not so busy. However, there are still some reasons to visit. The Aluvian mask maker lives here in the second floor of the smithy. The Aluvian shadow armor smith lives along the north road. A branch of the Title Bestower's Guild is set up here. Also, many shortcut portals for the Gaerlan quest are located here. And more recently, what seems to be a permanent portal to Asheron's Isle is open next to the town's windmill.",

I have also been told that he stays on the move, speaking with the troops and formulating plans, so he may be difficult to find. Search in the deepest areas of the excavation, and I am sure you'll find him soon enough. Once he is dead, return to me.\".

Other mana drawing creatures in the area of a mana field will prevent purity.\" Cypher the Apprentice tells you, \"Use this modified mana stone when you're in the presence of a cleansed mana field in the facility.\" Cypher the Apprentice tells you, \"You will need to align yourself with the mana flow of each floor first and then the central mana field of that floor.\" Cypher the Apprentice tells you, \"The entrance of the facility can be located at 46.2S, 71.8W where recent exploration exposed a previously inert portal.\"."
